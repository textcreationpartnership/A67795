            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:34188:6"/>is great and very common, and thoſe that fear the Lord, muſt take heed thereof, and contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt ſeek to elevate them ſelves up to God, in obſerving what his hand worketh and doth in his grace and divine love. If we muſt draw fruit out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words of the living, ſo then we ought to do the ſame in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner out of the lively words of thoſe that die in the Lord, and are taken up into his Glory. We all are going to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and every moment of our lives are as ſo many ſteps made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. And ſo every one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thitherward by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and commeth to it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before he thought on it, or waited for it. Time is given to us for to make proviſion for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and unhappy are thoſe who looſe and neglect it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it not for him who will ſave to all eternity thoſe who have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

How juſt then is it, that all thoſe who love him ſhould follow him into that glorious manſion place with gladneſs, and in being raviſhed with that inexpreſſible joy which is proper to Chriſtians?

            <p>WE need not to ſpeak any thing whereby to make known this Servant of God, becauſe ſhe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known in theſe provinces. Though ſhe might have had in the world all that is commonly ſought there in, yet ſhe hath deſpiſed it even from her youth. In theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes wherein corruptions are very extream, ſhe was one of the firſt of her condition, who durſt make open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſs, treading under her feet the vanitys and falſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the world.

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34188:10"/>the laſt years of her age. Her patience in her ſufferings and pains hath been notable long ago: eſpecially in the 27. year of her age, when there was neceſſity to cut a canker out of her breaſt, wherewith the Lord had viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her for her triall, &amp; to be glorified in her, cauſing her to ſuffer as ſhe did. The wicked world ſeeing her ſtrength and courage, which in this caſe did appear, and being neither willing nor able to give honor to God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, would rather ſay that the woman at Gorcum, who did cut her, had bewitched her, then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſupport and help, which God's Grace in this neceſſity had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded unto her. The inward trials of her ſoul, for a long time, have been greater then the trials of her body. At ſoon as ſhe had ſpoken with that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God Mr. Labadie in the year 1666. when we came into theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, ſhe found her heart inwardly joint with that grace, which God had laid in the heart of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſhe felt lively in her minde, that it was the ſame thing that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34188:10"/>ſo long ſhe had ſought for: which cauſed her to ſay with great joy to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of her friends, <hi>I have found a Man of God.</hi> She followed God at his call, and nothing was able to keep her back in his way. Yet however, it hath coſt her much to be throughly purged: but ſhe hath allways found, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the laſt years of her life, how good and faithfull God hath been to her in all his dealings with her, and in all thoſe wayes which he hath taken with her ſoul. He hath imployed her, ſince we came in Frieſland, to doe much good to divers, both in reſpect of ſoul and body. One ſoul amongſt others, whom God would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lthoug ſhe was hardly able to goe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o far, being already not very well to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as. From thence ſhe did caſt her eyes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34188:11"/>upon our churchyard, which ſhe could ſee from that place, with this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Lord would ſhortly cauſe her body to be brought thither. And God even at that time not giving her much ſenſe of his grace, ſhe remained in ſome ſadneſs before him. Being ſat down and a beam of the ſun ſhining on her face through the trees, ſhe felt a lively impreſſion that God would yet cauſe his glorious face to ſhine upon her; and withall perceiving that ont beam of God, being more lively and clearer then that of the ſun, did touch her heart and ſoul, and gave her the ſenſe that after her departure out of the world God would certainly cauſe her to enter into his glory, to be allwayes with him.</p>
            <p>In this ſickneſs, which did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſome time, before ſhe kept her bed, ſhe had a deep impreſſion, that God would ſpeedily take her out of the world. And though ſhe found her ſelf burdened with many diſeaſes, which preſſed her on all ſides, yet ſhe ſaid allwayes that her whole heart was diſpoſed to leave her ſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34188:11"/>to God, and not to uſe many reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, entreating that we would but commit her to the Lord, and his divine hand, in which ſhe found all her reſt. And this ſhe ſpake with ſuch an affection which penetrated her heart, and did put her above her ſelf and all her weakneſſes. <hi>The counſel of God,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>muſt needs be fulſilled: It is his will that I ſhould ſuffer, ſometimes after one manner, and ſometimes after another. Lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e me to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her laſt weakneſſes did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſome monthes. They tooke their beginning with great paines in her loins, and with a fit of the gravell: to which ſhe was much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Afterwards ſhe began to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite very much, not being well able to retain that which ſhe took for her ſuſtainance. She looked upon this inconvenience as was that of an other perſon amongſt us, which was not thereby remarkably weakened. But for her it was very incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, eſpecially at night time, for then ſhe ſuffered much, and paſſed the ſame many times without cloſing</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34188:12"/>
            <p> As long as ſhe could ſhe remained upon her leggs, having kept her bed wholly but a few dayes. But ſhe ſhould have done it ſooner, if lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve had not powerfully ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, and made her to forget her ſelf and her uneaſineſs, to help her brothers and ſiſters. This for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting &amp; denying of her ſelf hath been very evident &amp; ſpecial. Some monthes ſince the Lord in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence applying her a new to help the ſick among his children, ſhe ſaid that <hi>ſhe felt as the laſt outgoings of her haert to God, to beſtow the remainder of her ſtrength with love on him and thoſe that are his.</hi> We did many times admire, how ſhe did at day time go and come with ſo much zeal &amp; ſtrength, when ſhe had paſt the nigt before ſo ill &amp; with ſo much uneaſe. But we ſaw that we muſt leave her to God &amp; his Spirit, and to his love which did preſs her to doe for his children what ſhe did.</p>
            <p>She could hardly be perſwaded that we ſhould conſult with the Doctor, one of our friends, and yet leſs that he ſhould come to viſit her: But at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34188:12"/>laſt ſhe conſented to it, giving way to our hearty deſires, and to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecttions of our tenderneſs and love, which did move us, if it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſing to God, to give her ſome help or eaſe. The Doctor was much comforted, and glad in God, when he viſited her, and found her ſoul in that frame, in which it was, though he ſaw very well, that little help could be given to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>She had a great hunger &amp; thirſt to the word of God, &amp; did cheriſh her ſelf up oftentimes, that ſhe might hear ſpeaking of him in the aſſembly of his children: for this was her great joy &amp; comfort. A few dayes before her diſſolution ſhe was yet in the aſſembly, &amp; found her ſelf thereby as wholly refreſhed, comforted &amp; lifted up to God.</p>
            <p>Two dayes before her death, as we came out of the aſſembly, &amp; I told her that one point was handled which did much agree with her ſtate, and that all of us were touched very much there with, the children of the Lord with a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34188:13"/>tender acknowledgement calling to mind the works of her love, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in deep humility: <hi>Alas what have I done for them! I have received more demonſtrations of their love in two dayes, then I have given them all the dayes of my life. But if God ſhould again reſtore me, ô with what heart &amp; love &amp; joy would I ſerve them!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame day in the morning by time ſhe had a great deſire to ſpeak with me, &amp; to tell me <q>That the Lord did confirm my words to her heart, that he did more &amp; more draw near to her, that he ſhewed himſelf to her ſoul, that he came &amp; was come; and though he was not altogether near at hand, that yet he gave, in beholding of him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his reſt, to feel his peace, &amp; to give her ſelf wholly into his hands.</q> From that time alſo we ſaw in her a new enlargement of ſpiritual life, divine ſtrength &amp; pure joy in God &amp; CHRIST her Saviour. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to her laſt breaht, ſhe gave ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall cauſe of comfort, holy joy &amp; bleſſing of God, to all thoſe which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34188:13"/>have ſeen and heard her.</p>
            <p>For as much as by all what was given to her, ſhe got no eaſe, &amp; that even the beſt things and that which did allwayes help her before, did ſeem now to be become quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her; ſhe rejoyced in the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, becauſe he had taken away from her all creature help, that ſo he might take away from her all ſtay &amp; ſupport which at any time ſhe might have placed in them, and ſhe ſaid many times with a great impreſſion: <hi>No more creatures, I need the Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the ſame day, ſhe did entreat thoſe who were about her bed, that they ſhould ſing the 42 pſalm.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Like as the hart doth breath &amp; bray</hi>

                  <hi>The well ſprings to obtain,</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>whereby ſhe was ſo much moved, that ſhe did even melt in teares &amp; in tenderneſs of heart &amp; love for God, for whom ſhe groaned without ceaſing.</p>
            <p>A little after, my Brother Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignon, who by reaſon of his great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34188:14"/>indiſpoſition had not yet been out of his chamber, coming to viſit her, though it was bad weather, and the cold ſomething ſharp, ſhe was ſo very ſenſible of it, that ſhe could not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſs it, ſaying ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of all the love that, was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to her, which however, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not reſiſt; adding there unto, that what was told her by my worthy Brother, <hi>did pull up her heart to God, to make her ſpeedily to fly up to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which moſt conſtantly and tenderly did affect her heart, was that ſhe had not ſufficiently glorified the goodneſs and mercy of the Lord, which ſhe found to be ſo great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: <hi>That,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>goeth through my heart.</hi> And lifting up her ſoul to God, ſhe added: <hi>I doe ſink, I doe ſink in thy bottomleſs gulfe, O my God. O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, art thou ſo good to ſuch a ſinner, that thou doeſt pardon me all my ſins, my many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſins, my infinite ſins!</hi> And turning her ſelf a little to our ſiſter van de P. ſhe ſaid: <hi>My beloved ſiſter, O how great a grace! I would very willingly go to the houſe of my Father, however I have deſerved
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34188:14"/>that he ſhould ſay, Stay there thou naughty child, ſtay yet longer in the world.</hi> The night which was between ſunday and monday, our ſiſter van de P. with an other watching by her, they ſaw that ſhe had great pains and ſuffered mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then ordinarily, eſpecially by the generall convulſions of her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, through all her body; but ſhe endured it with ſo much patience and acknowledgement of the help which was given to her, that they could not but be touched therewith, and be ſenſible of it <hi>Pray the Lord for me,</hi> ſaid ſhe. And as ſoon as ſhe was ſomething eaſed, ſhe inſtantly deſired that they would be pleaſed to take ſome reſt, it being a trouble to her that they did it not.</p>
            <p>On ſunday evening our ſiſter van de P. relating to her, that I found my ſelf to be thus employed before God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her and her ſtate, that I had ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce any thing elſe in my heart and houghts, and that I felt, that God was good to her, and would in a ſpeciall manner be ſo: She anſwered, <hi>Lord what doeſt thou not let
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34188:15"/>me hear, who am ſo unworthy! My God, thou art willing even to overburden me with thy goodneſs!</hi> The Lord giving me more opportunity to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, then to my dear Brother Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignon, ſhe accepted all whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſaid unto her, with ſo much tenderneſs and thankfullneſs, for the love and care which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de us to have for her, that ſhe was wholly taken up therewith. On the one ſide her deep humility was the cauſe that ſhe felt her ſelf to be unworthy of ſo many viſits; but on the other ſide her deſire to it was ſo great, and her joy for it ſo lively and powerfull, that ſhe could not keep it in.</p>
            <p>My Brother Dulignon telling her, Beloved Siſter, you ſhall die in ſuch manner as we our ſelves would deſire to die: her heart was lively touched thereby, and with great affection going out to the Lord.</p>
            <p>On monday at noon whilſt we were at dinner, ſhe entreated again our ſiſter van de P. to ſing the firſt vers of the 42. Pſalm. And after
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34188:15"/>ſhe had ſung it in French, and ſung it over again in Dutch, our ſiſter Huyghens did ſing it with her with ſuch fullneſs of heart and loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of voice, that we could heare it below; and one ſhould not ſay then, that her end was ſo near by. Afterwards our ſiſter van de P. ſung to her theſe three verſes out of one of our ſongs.</p>

            <p>Wherewith all ſhe joyned herſelf in a ſpeciall manner, &amp; deſired that the ſame might be repeated to her again, by reaſon of that ſpeciall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which ſhe had therein.</p>
            <p>Being oftentimes viſited by divert of the children of the Lord, ſhe ſaid when they were gone: <hi>O how lovely doth the Lord make them!</hi> A brother ſeeing her to ſuffer, and being thereby moved very much, did ſay: Worthy ſiſter, I pray to God that it may be his will to leſſen your pains. I am tenderly moved to ſee you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much; But I cannot bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne you, becauſe I ſee you by the means here of to draw near to the Lord, &amp; to your full delivrance. Which thoughts ſhe embraced with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34188:16"/>joy and ſpeciall pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Our Siſter van de P. having ſaid unto her, We doe beleeve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the Lord will take you to himſelf, but we hope that he will give us yet firſt more opportunity, to ſhew to you the love which the Lord hath given to us for you; She ſaid on the moonday evening: <hi>Wel my ſiſter, I now may very well go: for I have certainly received ſufficient proofs of your love.</hi> And where as they were talking, who were to watch the night of the day after, ſhe aſſerted: <hi>There need no care for that, there will be no need of it.</hi> And withall ſhe aſked, <hi>Are not they to waſh to morrow? ô I hope that the Lord Jeſus will wholly waſh my ſoul to morrow.</hi> And the next day, which was the day ſhe died, ſhe ſaid, having reſpect to theſe two things, <hi>Have not I told it to you?</hi> She was as raviſhed, when ſhe thought thereon, that ſhe ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, and wholly made white in the blood of JESUS CHRIST, &amp; throug the full effuſion of his Spirit upon her: <hi>O,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>not to ſin any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34188:17"/>more, not to be able to ſin any more, what great happineſs is that!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The night which was between monday &amp; tueſday, our ſiſter van S. watching with our ſiſter C. who did uſually take care of the ſick with Mrs. Huyghens, ſhe ſhewed much thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs to God, becauſe he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingh aſſwage her paines, although her anguiſhes were yet great; and ſhe received with much tenderneſs &amp; humility that ſervice which was done to her, ſaying: <q>Behold, how much ſervice doe I want? It is good that men doe ſomething enter into the ſtate of the ſick; one ſhould ſometimes think that they have no need of ſo many things.</q> She did not think on her ſelf but with relation to others, and through that ſenſe which charity did give to her. This made her in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner to ſay to our brother D. taking him by the hand: <q>My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, many have aſked me whether I had any thing to ſay to them, &amp; I had nothing: but I will tell you: For as much as at preſent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34188:17"/>you are to have the ſpeciall care for the ſick, that you doe wholly &amp; with great application give you ſelf thereunto.</q> 
               <hi>O how much have you hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped me,</hi> ſaid ſhe more then once to our Siſter van S. <hi>If you had not been ſo ſtrong as to raiſe me up oftentimes, I had failed in my anguiſhings. What a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full help have you been to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Tueſday morning ſhe found herſelf wholly faint in all her limbs, and to be taken with a ſleep which did nothing but make her more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. Whereupon ſhe ſaid very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, <hi>Now God will give ſome change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor being come ſome time afterwards, &amp; finding her to be ſo weak, that many remedys were not to be given unto her any more, ſhe was very glad, ſeeing that God did make her by degrees draw nearer &amp; nearer to her end, and that no help was to be exſpected any more from the creatures, being not to live any longer here below. <hi>O how doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that the opinion of the Doctor is not contrary to mine!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About an hour after dinner out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34188:18"/>ſiſter Y. ſaying to her: My worthy ſiſter, God hath made you to paſſe through many trialls, and now long ago: <q>
                  <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, the Lord hath tried me indeed; but however, he hath been allwayes with me.</q> Yet ſhe was even then in great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, in which ſhe found her ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſlumbred a little while. And when ſhe felt death to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Shall I no more ſee our beloved Brethren, our worthy Paſtors?</hi> (We were juſt gone down with the Doctor.) This then was told us, &amp; coming preſently to her, we found her in great faintneſs, and we lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up our ſelves to God (as we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did,) offering up unto him for an oblation this worthy ſoul, &amp; giving her over in the hands of the Lord JESUS, her great &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Shepherd.</p>
            <p>She was at that time in unuſuall anguiſhments, which cauſed ſuch great &amp; ſuddain changes in her, that one could cleerly ſee, that ſhe haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened much towards her end, and that likely it would not be long, befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34188:18"/>ſhe ſhould attaine to it. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſometimes, as if ſhe ſhould be gone in thoſe faint fits, but ſhe came to her ſelf againe. The firſt word that ſhe ſaid, ſpeaking to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, was: <q>O Sir, how good is it to live &amp; die among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God! How much help and ſupport doth one receive from them! ô how great a good is it!</q> And for as much as I ſaid unto her, My worthy ſiſter, we cannot help you, nor give you any eaſe; ſhe did anſwere with great feeling of heart: <hi>Yea indeed you can help me, and you doe help me.</hi> But the mind &amp; heart, where with ſhe did ſpeak this &amp; ſo many other things, are not well to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, which had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love to our houſe, ſaid to her, that it would have been a great greef to him, if he had not been with her that day, and that having had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acquaintance with her, ſhe ſhould have gone to the Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ſeen her in that comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate wherein he ſaw her. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34188:19"/>cauſe, as he added, even as Salomon ſaith, <q>it is better to goe into the houſe of mourning, then into the houſe of feaſting, for there is the end of all fleſh, and the living doth lay it to heart:</q> ſhe thereupon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with a laughing mouth and joyfull heart: <q>A houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? No Sir, this is no houſe of mourning; it is a houſe of laughter, and a houſe of joy. Doe not you behold the heart of my dear brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and ſiſters? Doe not you ſee how joyfull they are? and how they thank God for the grace which he ſheweth unto me? And though by reaſon of my weakneſs they doe not now ſing out aloud, O they will doe it hereafter, as ſoon as I ſhall have paſſed over to the Lord.</q> And turning her ſelf towards us, ſhe proceeded on to ſay: <q>Is it not true, worthy brethren and ſiſters, that you doe rejoyce, and that you will praiſe the Lord for my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? O doe it, doe it, I pray you, as ſoon as I ſhall be gone to my God.</q> And applying her ſelf in a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34188:19"/>ſpeciall manner to our ſiſter van de P. ſhe ſaid: <q>Will not you doe it my dear ſiſter? Will not you praiſe the Lord? I pray, doe it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor being willing to make her to take ſomething, ſhe ſaid divers times, <hi>I have no need any more, I have no need of a cordiall,</hi> deſiring to acquaint them that ſhe had her cordial in her heart. And one telling her that it was but a little of the ſpirit of lemons, ſhe replyed, <hi>Doe not ſpeak to me of any more ſpirits.</hi> And when thereupon I ſaid unto her, My ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, you are dead unto the creatures, you muſt have the holy Ghoſt for your cordiall; ſhe ſaid divers times: <q>Yea my worthy Brother, yea it is he, and he alone, whom I doe want.</q> We ſaw her indeed dead unto the exſpectation of any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, and it troubled her to hear us ſpeak of it; not by reaſon of any naturall contrariety, for ſhe had none in the leaſt againſt the moſt lothſome things before her ſickneſs, when the Lord would have it to be: but becauſe her heart and mind was ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34188:20"/>much taken up with God, that ſhe could not ſo much as think on that which is here below. And likewiſe we found that all things did her hurt, and the Doctor ſaid, that he ſaw that nothing was more fit for her then the wine ſpunge, which from time to ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me during her ſickneſs we were wont to give unto her, to ſtrengthen her. Her anguiſhments being again grown very great, I did preſent her befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the Lord, praying unto him for the continuance of the aſſiſtance of his divine grace &amp; power to his ſervant, that was ſuffering before his eyes and at his feet. Where upon falling in a great faintneſs, ſhe laid her ſelf down upon her pillow, ſaying: <hi>I looſe my ſelf in God for ever.</hi> A little after my Brother Dulignon ſaying unto her, Well my worthy Siſter, the Lord will come, and will ſpeedily come; ſhe encouraged her ſelf to tell him: <hi>Yea my worthy brother, yea indeed he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Which ſhe repeated three or four times, with ſo much tenderneſs of heart, that we clearly ſaw that her heart was wholly penetrated, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34188:20"/>burning with love towards the Lord Jeſus. Afterwards ſhe fell into a little ſleep, which did continue for about the ſpace of a quarter of an hour. And for as much as we did ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, that ſhe did allwayes come out of thoſe ſlumbrings with great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, we therefore did admire to ſee her coming out of this, ſo full of life and ſpirituall ſtrength, by which it did evidently appear, that the Lord was come yet nearer unto her, and that the ſenſe of his lovely preſence had, as it were, even wholly refreſhed and renewed her. Being indeed full thereof, ſhe could not keep her ſelf from crying out with a loud voyce and ſpeciall ſtrength: <hi>O how good is the Lord! O how good is he! My God, art thou ſo good to me! My God, my Father, could I at any time conceive it? O how great is God! Let every one looſe him ſelf in him, and in his goodneſs; Yea let every one looſe him ſelf in him, and give him ſelf wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto Him.</hi> But it would not be poſſible to relate all the words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, where with her heart and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34188:21"/>mouth, for the time of more then half an hour did overflow, with ſuch a lifting up of her minde to God, and union of her heart with Jeſus Chriſt, that all thoſe that did hear and ſee her, were holily taken up with it, not being able to doe any thing elſe but thank God from the bottom of their hearts, for this plentifull effuſion of his Spirit and Grace, of his light and love, wherewith he had ſo much filled up this veſſell, that it did run over in ſuch a pure, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and loving manner. And for as much as we were come round about her bed, to ſee her to finiſh her cours and triumph, ſhe looked round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her upon every one of us with great pleaſure, and praiſed God that ſhe found her ſelf to be compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſuch a number of Gods children: <hi>Theſe are,</hi> ſaid ſhe to the Doctor, <hi>my worthy Bretheren and Siſters. O how lovely are they!</hi> Indeed, the love which God had given to her for all his children, is not to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Afterwards becauſe we ſaw that her mouth began to grow ſomething
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34188:21"/>dry, and we aſked her if ſhe would not drink, ſhe anſwered, <hi>No, but I go to drink, I go to drink the waters of life: there will be quenching and refreſhment.</hi> And turning her ſelf about to our ſiſter van de P., ſhe ſaid: <hi>Did not I tell you that to day I ſhould be waſhed in that great lavour of the blood of Jeſus? And this ſhall be. I drown my ſelf,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>in that Sea, yea in that great Sea.</hi> And we ſaw that her heart and ſoul did even flote away in love to God, ſinking in the bottomleſs ocean of his mercy and of the blood of Chriſt her Saviour.</p>
            <p>She ſpoke with an inexpreſſable ſenſe of the beauty, glory, and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord Jeſus: oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating theſe words, <hi>O what is he not!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having kept ſilence ſome time, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I go to embrace him in the name of you all.</hi> And turning her ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, ſhe ſaid: <hi>tell it, I pray you, to our two brethren which are abſent, that I am going to embrace the Lord Jeſus in their name &amp; tho name of you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy brethren &amp; ſiſters,</hi> ſaid ſhe, with a ſpeciall affection, and a very great impreſſion, <q>Fear not death, it is not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34188:22"/>bitter: no it is ſweet, it is ſweet &amp; good. Be not afraid of it, it is very well to be born. The bitterneſs of death is paſt;</q> adding unto it <q>who was it that ſaid ſo? But I ſpeak it in an other ſens.</q> And when I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, He who ſpake thoſe words, thought that he ſhould not die, but you ſay them, ſeeing death coming on &amp; embracing it: I, ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſo it is that I mean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She ſaid, <q>Fear not to go to God: Doe not you heare it, brethren and ſiſters? It is good to looſe our ſelves in him: then we are truely ſave. O how doe I feel it and have experience of it! I did not think that death was ſo ſweet.</q> And ſhortly after: <q>I die every minute, and yet I live ſtill. God worketh no miracles to free us from the croſs. I muſt ſuffer, God will have it to be ſo, and I likewiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>How ſad and terrible a thing would it be to me, ſaid ſhe, if God now ſhould be terrible to my ſoul: Death would be untolerable to me.</q>

            <p>And while as at divers times ſhe had ſhewen much zeal for the ſouls of her Friends, and a fervent deſire that God through his grace might be glorified in them, I therefore aſked her a few hours before her death, if ſhe did deſire that I ſhould write any thing in particular to her ſiſter Mrs. Verbrugge, and to Mr. Huyghen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her Brother. And ſhe anſwered me: <hi>Nothing but that I leave them to the Lord, that I have committed them unto him, and that in love I doe tenderly ſalute them.</hi> And aſking her yet, ſhall not I doe the ſame to Madam van O. She
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34188:24"/>anſwered, <hi>Should not you? you knows how much I have allwayes loved her with her worthy Siſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Siſter Magdalene, whoſe happy deceaſe ſhall likewiſe be found here, telling her two monthes before her end, that ſhe did as yet feel ſome fear, when ſhe beheld death; ſhe ſaid to her chearfully: <q>You muſt come &amp; ſee me die, for I ſhall not live long any more; and then you will have no more fear for death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Even as in her life-time ſhe had a great zeal for the elect of God, and the eſtabliſhment &amp; enlargement of the kingdom of JESUS CHRIST in their ſoules, which was the cheef matter of her deſires &amp; prayers: ſo likewiſe ſhe did in a ſpeciall manner enlarge them in her laſt hour. Not by any motion of her own, or any thing that would as prevent the Lord by doing that which he did not, or more then he did or found good to doe: For in this thing ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much light from the Lord, and ſhe humbled herſelf before him for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34188:25"/>that mixtur of her own work in times paſt, with that which ſhould have been only the Lords work but her heart went forh with much tenderneſs to God for his Elect, that are in ſo much danger in the midſt of the world. And ſhe did ſhew that ſhe was eſpecially ſenſible, whether it was of the ſtate of thoſe on whom God by his Grace had truely wrought, and that did yet remain compaſſed about with great darkneſs and wants, or whether it was for the ſtate of thoſe elect who had not yet heard of Chriſt. It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed how tenderly ſenſible ſhe was there of.</p>
            <p>She ſaid that ſhe would pray to the Lord Jeſus for the converſion of the poor Indians, for whom ſhe had a very ſpeciall zeal, being contented, ſhe ſaid, if God ſhould give her life and did make ſome of us to go there, to be one of the firſt, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her weakneſs, ſicklineſs, and years.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes in the ſenſe of her infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſhe ſaid very meekly: <hi>J beſeech
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34188:25"/>you, pray unto the Lord for me, for I am ſure I have need of his grace and ſtrength to endure my pains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some time before ſhe died, ſhe ſaid to me in much humility: <hi>My worthy Brother, I have not deſired pardon of you for all the pains which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you.</hi> And I anſwering her, the Lord JESUS hath forgiven and attoned all, ſhe replyed, <hi>This I had likewiſe thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little before her death ſhe did deſire to have ſome beere for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, refuſing the rinniſh wine which was preſented unto her, and which ſhe could not well endure in her ſickneſs. A little after ſhe ſaid, <hi>Let me now ſtretch out my ſelf, for it is done, it is done.</hi> Whereupon ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſoftſleep which was the very ſleep of death, for ſhe deceaſed in the Lord half a quarter of an hour after, with a very great reſt, peace &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</p>
            <p>On this manner hath this ſoul ſo much beloved by God &amp; his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, happily finiſhed her courſe. She was, to ſay indeed, not very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34188:26"/>ſick, but only the two laſt dayes of her life, for before that, there was as much likelyhood that God would reſtore her again, as that he would take her out of this world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God gave her to the very laſt ſuch a great preſence of ſpirit; ſuch a lively memory, ſuch a ſolidity of judgement, ſo holy &amp; couragious a confidence, and ſo perfect a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all whatſoever her heart did love in God, that one might clearly ſee, that there was in her an other life then that of the body, which did ſupport, inaminate and more enliven her, then at any time before. She is now with God, and reſteth in his boſom from her labour. She is bleſſed being dead in the Lord, his Grace having prevented her, his Glory having received her, and the works of her love which God gave her to doe, having followed her. She looked little on them in her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but yet leſs in her death. And God who is good &amp; faithfull to thoſe that belong to him, hath crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her with his Glory the gifts
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34188:26"/>of his Grace, which in Chriſt he had imparted unto her. The Lord JESUS be for evermore praiſed for the accompliſhment of his work in her, and to him be given the honour &amp; glory, by all thoſe who ſhall read this writing, the which we make common by aiming thereat &amp; wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, by the ſenſe of his Spirit, and his divine love.</p>

If I did not committ you and your ſufferings to the Lord, my heart would be wounded through with ſmart: but God is ſpecially good to me therein, that he taketh away from me all encombrances for what matter ſoever it be.

               <p> The ſame day in the morning ſhe ſaid to us: <hi>God makes me for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his mercy, how unprofitable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant I have been in his houſe.</hi> This ſhe ſaid with ſpeciall relation to this that ſhe had been ſickly for diven years, and not been able to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, to the help &amp; ſervice of the other children of the Lord, that which her love did put in her, and made her wiſh to be able to doe.

               </p>
               <p>She ſaid, <q>Notwithſtanding my unfaithfullneſs, and though I have not lived for his glory, as I ought to have done, yet he is ſo good to me now.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34188:35"/>by reaſon of the anguiſh of her heart they gave to her a little Beſor for her eaſe, but ſhe would hardly take it, ſaying: <hi>That will ſerve for an other one, as for me I go to God, and whether it be with more or leſs anguiſh, is it not all one? That doth not deſerve the Beſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She had ſaid before to ſome one: <hi>Let none tell the child, that his mother is dead, but that ſhe is a life in God, that ſhe is with the Lord Jeſus in heaven. I know not,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>this word</hi> Death <hi>ſeems to be ſo ſtrange in this caſe, me thinks ti doth not expreſſe the thing very well: for to go to the Lord, is indeed not to die.

               <p>She likewiſe h at ſaid to that per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, <q>Tell my ſiſters Vincentia &amp; Mary, when you ſhall ſee them, that I pray to God with all my heart, that he be pleaſed to bleſſe them, and though they have not been here, that there hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to me; the love of God &amp; of his children having plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully provided in all things.</q>

               <p>And afterwards turning her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to us, ſhe ſaid: <hi>I can ſay that I wiſh to all of you with all my heart the ſame good, and that you were all in the ſame ſtate as I be.</hi> And anſwering her that ſuch wiſhes are not uſually made, but that indeed it was the greateſt which ſhe could wiſh to us, becauſe there was no greater good then that good whereunto God did call her, then ſhe ſaid: <q>I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes thought that if we ſhould take a voyage to ſea, and the Lord ſhould then by ſhipwrack take us all to himſelf, that it would be a great comfort that we might thus all go together to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She ſaid, <hi>One may be very well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that death hath nothing terrible for

               </p>
               <p>And furthermore ſhe ſaid, <q>From my youth God hath made himſelf ſenſible to my ſoul, though I did not then know him, and my heart was yet blind: But thereby he did hinder me from being able to take my delight in the world &amp; what is in the world: and as ſoon as I had found the pure Spirit of the Lord in his Servants, I ſaid by my ſelf: This is it which thou haſt ſought for, and by this thou muſt keep thy ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I can wel ſay it (went ſhe forth with a feeling which was very lively &amp; pure) for God hath done it, and it is not but for his glory: that when the Lord JESUS made him ſelf known to my ſoul, the world from that time forth did vaniſh away from my eyes, and ſince it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alwayes vaniſhed. And I could not comprehend, how that ſouls, which have felt JESUS, could afterwards love any thing elſe but JESUS.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About noon one of our ſiſters aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34188:36"/>her, whether ſhe would not make uſe of ſome broth of veal, or ſomething elſe, ſo ſhe anſwered with joy of heart, <q>That I had told her that there would be no more night for her, and that ſhe could very well ſubſiſt ſo long without uſing any thing;</q> adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <q>that when ſhe had taken any thing, thereby her anguiſh was more encreaſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About the ſame time, when they had ſhut her courtains, theſe words were heard to come out of her boſom: <hi>O God, thou canſt doe all things; might it pleaſe thee to ſhorten the time!</hi> having no other deſire but to be haſtily with the Lord.</p>
               <p>Her anguiſhes were oftentimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, ſo that they did hinder her for ſome time to ſpeak &amp; to ſay any thing: but afterwards ſhe came out of them again with new ſtrength and vigour, and with a renewing of her joy, becauſe ſhe looked upon that continuall falling again into thoſe fits of anguiſh, as ſo many ſteps which ſhe made towards the Lord
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34188:37"/>JESUS her Saviour, the beloved of her heart &amp; the eternall Bridegroom of her ſoul.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon being come again to ſee her, and aſking her how ſhe found herſelf: <hi>I waite,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>for the Lord: bleſſed is that ſervant, which waiteth for his Lord, he will not be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> At another time being in great anguiſh, ſhe ſaid to me: <hi>The Lord, my worthy Brother, will have us to wait upon him, is it not true? One muſt wait till his minute be come, it is the greateſt we can expect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O how ready is the Lord</hi> JESUS, ſaid ſhe to ſome ſiſters who came to ſee her, <q>to receive ſinners, which are ſorry, that they have noth been ſufficiently for him, when they doe take their refuge to his divine merits, and doe truſt their ſoules into his hands.</q> And ſpeaking to ſome of our brethren, ſhe ſaid, <q>Be faithfull to the Lord JESUS, my brethren; walk before his face, take but away what may hinder him from having communion with your ſoules, and you will find that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34188:37"/>he is wholy ready to cauſe himſlf to be felt on your heart. To be able to ſay unto the Lord, my God, I deſire none but thee in heaven &amp; on earth, what wilt thou have me to doe, that gives a great ſtrength, and maketh men to walk with heads lifted up. I have found that many times by his Grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I ſaid unto her, is it not a great good to have ſerved ſuch a good Maſter? ſhe anſwered me: <hi>One doth not repent, but only that one hath not ſufficiently ſerved him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Benjamin again coming before her bed, ſhe ſaid to him: <q>My child, I can ſay nothing elſe to you, but what I have allready ſaid. Fear the Lord alwayes, and be very obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thoſe that inſtruct you, then you will come to live for ever with your Mother in heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She ſaid to a certaine ſiſter, who for tenderneſs of heart did weep ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her: <q>One muſt not weep, one muſt rejoyce, and praiſe the Lord. Doe not you ſee, how much cauſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34188:38"/>he gives thereunto?</q> and ſpeaking to that ſiſter who takes care for the little children, ſhe ſaid, <q>God bleſſe you, my worthy ſiſter, with the little ones, take care of them, and that according to the Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I having told her at noon, Well my worthy Siſter, now is the day half paſt, ſhe anſwered, <hi>Are you then yet of the ſame opinion, my worthy Brother? Doe you beleeve yet that even this day I ſhall go to my Redeemer and my God?</hi> And at evening going to ſupper, I aſked her, becauſe ſhe ſeemed to have gotten a little ſtrength again, whether ſhe was not willing to take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And ſhe anſwered with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <q>Muſt I yet eat, what ſad tidings! I made in my ſelf an other reckoning: yet if God pleaſe I will try it.</q> And our Brother who hath the care of the ſick, having told her before that ſhe had gotten a little more ſtrength, ſhe gave him this anſwer: <hi>Doe you likewiſe bring had ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: you have told me that I was ſo near to my end.</hi> She had before that thanked him, and that Siſter that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34188:38"/>helps him, with much tenderneſs for their love, and for ſo many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſhe had received thereof, eſpecially in her ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>After meal coming to ſee her again, and finding her in greater anguiſh, ſhe ſaid, as ſhe had done at other times, <hi>that her hope did encreaſe.</hi> And ſpeaking of my worthy Brother her husband, whoſe ſtate had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as near to eternity as was that of hers, ſhe ſaid, <hi>That ſhe expected to ſee him in heaven, and never to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from him again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that we had again preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her before the Lord as a ſacrifice, according to the feeling which he gave me, that it might pleaſe him to hear the great &amp; ardent affection of his child and faithfull handmaid, who alone went out to him, ſhe did yet boſom out theſe words: <hi>I would ſay with my mother, as ſhe ſaid at the end of her life, I can no more.</hi> And turning herſelf towards me, ſhe ſaid: <hi>I have never yet been in ſuch an anguiſh, my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy brother.</hi> To which I anſwered that ſhe did put me in mind of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34188:39"/>thy Siſter Huyghens, who likewiſe told me the ſame a little before her end, but that God took her to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf half an hour after. This did cauſe her ſuch joy, that her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thereby was changed. A little after ſhe yeelded up her ſpirit, the joy remaining imprinted in her face &amp; eyes, which I did ſhut unto her, praiſing God for that unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable happineſs, unto which he had received this ſoul, who was ſo beloved &amp; dear to CHRIST &amp; his children.</p>
               <p>I can ſay to the glory of God, that I doe not beleeve, that one can eaſily i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine in any a greater, a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and a more permanent longing for death, then what we have ſeen in her; a fuller aſſurance of going to eternal happineſs, a more perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetlement from all what ſhe left in the world; more forgetfulneſs and holy contempt of her ſelf; and more innocent ſimplicity in the outgoings of her heart to God &amp; to JESUS her Lord &amp; Saviour, who having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented &amp; accompanied her with his

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34188:40"/>unto him, gave unto her a generall deſire, that ſhe might be able to know him, and to ſerve him in truth. Oftentimes when ſhe went to the maſſe &amp; veſper, and there prayed to God, ſhe felt in her heart, that that manner of worſhipping God was not acceptable unto him: and having once heard ſome body ſpeaking of the holy Scriptures, which ſhe might not read, ſhe felt a great &amp; inward deſire, to ſeek out ſuch people which might be able to teach her, in what manner God would be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Even from that time ſhe reſolved, after that ſhe had pondered all things well, and was a long while in her heart urged thereunto, to betake her ſelf upon her journey, without knowing where to go; hoping that God would guide her, and let her find that which ſhe felt was her duty to ſeek. Then ſhe ſpoke with a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, which went a foot from Metz to Frankfort, being then 19. years &amp; a half old, deſiring him that he would take her with him, though
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34188:40"/>ſhe knew no body there, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did not at all underſtand the German tongue. The meſſenger not being willing to take her with him, except her mother would give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto, ſo her mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, being weary of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all oppoſition of her daughter againſt her worldly mindedneſs. Her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, which was not unwilling to keep her goods in his hands, was likewiſe well contented that ſhe ſhould go where it pleaſed her. So that the meſſenger took upon him to take her with him, God fitting all things thereunto according to her wiſh. She thought indeed at firſt, to get into her hands the goods which by her father did belong unto her, and could likewiſe have done it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of the country, if ſhe had ſtayed there but 6 monthes longer, that is till the age of twenty years: but this was to her impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for when ſhe did pray moſt unto the Lord, that he would make his will known to her concerning this point, ſo ſhe felt her ſelf to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34188:41"/>conſtrained very much to depart, being greatly afraid that ſhe might happen to die in theſe 6 monthes; without yet knowing what the Lord required of her ſoul, that ſhe would rather leave all there, and follow the inclination of her heart, which ſhe did perceive was from God. Which likewiſe ſhe did, and that without ever lookink back after what ſhe had left in the hands of her Friends, and whereof ſhe hath not enjoyed the leaſt thing.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe went away from Metz towards Francfort with this meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and likewiſe another man and his wife, who alſo went to that place. In the way ſhe found an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy, becauſe that ſhe ſaw herſelf to be out of Metz, and in freedom to be able to ſeek the Lord, untill ſhe had found him. The way did not ſeem to her to be long, and god preſerved her in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the ſame. Being come to Francfort, ſhe was recommended to the Counteſſe of Hanau, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood that ſhe ſought to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34188:41"/>inſtructed in the reformed Religion, did direct her to a very good Lady of Caſſel, wife of the Marſhall Hax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſen, which did receive her with a heart ſo full of love, that ſhe could not have expected or deſired more, though ſhe had been her own mother. God had ſome ſhort time before po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully touched and changed the heart of that young Lady, ſo that ſhe went earneſtly about to change the train of her worldly life, which ſhe had led. She changed her houſe as into a church, in which ſhe cauſed God to be ſerved with all her power, and did rejoyce that ſhe could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe receive there &amp; help this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who did earneſtly ſeek God.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34188:42"/>any thing, yet giving her all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhe might be inſtructed. Wherein our ſiſter did ſee the tender &amp; fatherly providence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. The converſation &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of this Lady, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially her deceaſe, which was very edifying, did very much confirme her in that hope which ſhe had, to find the truth in the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But afterwards ſhe was kept back for ſome time to receive the ſame, by reaſon of the bad example of thoſe with whom ſhe did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently converſe, and eſpecially by that of a Candidate in Divinity, which concerned him ſelf with the inſtruction of others in the houſe, but was himſelf ſo profane, as to make a ſcoff &amp; laughing-ſtock of the words of the holy Scripture; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides by the evill example of the French Miniſter of Caſſell, which being invited to dinner to the place where ſhe dwelt, that he might have opportunity to ſpeak with her, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dinner did nothing elſe but ſpeak of meat &amp; drink, of good wine,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34188:42"/>and meat well prepared, &amp; that after a very fleſhly &amp; offenſive manner.</p>
               <p>Now when ſhe was in great ſtraight, to know what ſhe ſhould doe, praying to God night and day, and turning, as it was, into a ſkel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton by ſorrow, and with a great deſire which did even conſume her away, to know the right way which leadeth to God: So one day when ſhe kept her ſelf in prayer before Him, ſhe got this impreſſion, that ſhe muſt not be taken up with thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones which profeſſe the reformed Religion, but that the Religion in it ſelf, or the truth which therein was profeſſed, in oppoſition to the papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was truly according to Gods heart. And for as much as ſhe was oftentimes diſquieted, thinking whether ſhe had not done amis in leaving her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the fifth commandement coming often in her mind; then was her heart touched lively by the Lord, when ſhe was before him in prayer, and it was as if this word was ſaid to her by JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Will you for my ſake not deny your mother?</hi> Which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34188:43"/>at the firſt was very greevous for her to doe, but yet from that time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eaſy to her by the ſtrength of him who had applyed to her that word and command. All this made her to reſolve to give her ſelf over to all whatſoever the Lord ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of her; and after ſhe had prayed to him with many teras, that he would not ſuffer her, to take upon her the profeſſion of the proteſtant doctrine, for any reſpect of men which ſhould gladly ſee it, and that he would hinder that no ſuch thing might be mixed therewith, ſo ſhe found her ſelf fully reſolved thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſhe made her confeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a German miniſter, whoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſhe had then learned, and whom ſhe hought to fear God more then others. So God brought her to the knowledge of the truth &amp; of the ſound doctrine. But her heart ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life which in ſome meaſure might agree therewith, and having alwayes wiſhed to be with people that did ſerve God in truth, ſhe was inclined to go for Holland, to ſee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34188:43"/>if God would fullfill her deſire. But coming there, ſhe was very ſad to find the contrary in the firſt houſe, where however ſhe ſtayed three years, and there the Miſtris of the houſe requiring that ſhe ſhould ſay ſomething contrary to the truth, ſhe anſwered with great affection, that ſhe would rather die the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible death, then to wound her conſcience thereby. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the little help ſhe had, &amp; the evill example ſhe ſaw there were partly the cauſe that her ſoul went by degrees far off from the Lord, and that ſhe found her ſelf in a very ſad condition. Thus having in this &amp; other occaſion diſpleaſed her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris, ſhe went away from her, and was recommended to Madam of Sommelſdyck to educate a ſon of her daughter Madam of Oſſenbergh, in which ſhe did performe her duty with love, and inſtructing him ſhe did withall herſelf encreaſe in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Afterwards ſhe came in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghter of her Lady, and did in the end remain with Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34188:44"/>of Sommelſdyck our Siſter, whoſe heart at that time the Lord had touched, with three others of her ſiſters, and who gave her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect means to ſerve God, when from time to time the Lord made us to come in the Hague, and alſo ſtay thereſome time. In the year 1670 ſhe went with her Miſtris to Ryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh, and I afterwards by Gods Providence going into Germany, &amp; ſtopping a few dayes at the afore mentioned place with Madam of Oſſenbergh, ſhe was there freed from that ſad ſtate &amp; condition, in which her ſoul had been for divers years, and wherein ſhe had ſuffered very much within, and likewiſe had ſinned very much in her ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord: which was to her as painfull as death. That which ſhe had heard about the ſtate of Job, gave her light &amp; ſtrength, and did revive her hope again, which ſhe in her temptation &amp; conflicts had loſt very much. And likewiſe the Lord JESUS made himſelf one time very ſenſible to her heart, and gave her a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34188:44"/>great impreſſion of the myſtery of his croſſe, which remained lively with her for a long time.</p>
               <p>God having brought us at Herfort, ſhe came likewiſe there, and becauſe ſhe did know by long experience, that with all thoſe affections which God had given her, ſhe was but little dead to her ſelf, ſhe ſaid in the way, that ſhe found her ſelf as if ſhe was carried to the ſlaughter. And in that place likewiſe ſhe was much beſet by Gods truth &amp; his Spirit, untill ſhe was through his grace &amp; love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered quite after an other manner unto him. The Lord did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf to her very ſenſibly from time to time, and in a ſpeciall manner at Sonderen near Herfort. But becauſe her ſelf-love did very much mix it ſelf with that grace which ſhe did receive, God hath now &amp; then exerciſed her by inward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ryalls, and by divers temptations &amp; deſertions, wherein ſhe hath been to ſuffer, and conſtrained of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en times to looſe her ſelf in the hands of God, whether it was at Altena,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34188:45"/>or here in Frieſland. But the Lord hath been indeed good to her in all her way, and after that he had made her to ſubmit unto him, ſhe was in her laſt ſickneſs (which did continue long, and having begun with a third day ague, was changed into a dayly ague, and at the laſt into a dropſy) a great comfort to us, by reaſon of that ſoft, humble, and patient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, whereby ſhe was given over to God, and wherein he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to bear the ſame alwayes, and that through the ſpeciall enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his grace upon her.</p>
               <p>When this ſickneſs began to take its courſe, ſhe felt lively in her heart, that <hi>God did call her to ſuffering and to much ſuffering;</hi> but ſhe ſaid withall, as ſhe had done at more times, that <hi>God did give her a love to ſuffering, and that ſhe for the love of Jeſus her Saviour did bertily embrace that part of his croſſe which it ſhould pleaſe him to give her.</hi> And all that time that ſhe hath kept her bed, ſhe hath made it evident, that this love was inward &amp; true, and that ſhe did a freſh receive this grace from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34188:45"/>the Lord, not only in ſenſe, but in truth. She likewiſe felt what God did in her was ſuch, that ſhe could not doubt but if he ſhould reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore her again, ſhe would live and be wholly after an other manner for him, then till that time ſhe had done. And in the beginning her ague fits coming firſt againſt night ſhe gave thanks to God that he granted her to be able to doe ſomething at day time, to ſerve him and his Children.</p>
               <p>A certain morning, when the night before ſhe had been very bad, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>A little while after being much moved ſhe ſaid: <hi>My good Jeſus, wilt thou be ſo mercifull to me, that at preſent thou wilt fully waſh me clean in thy Blood? ô how great is that grace! how unworthy am I of it!

               <p>That ſiſter which talked with her, aſked if ſhe deſired any thing of her, and ſhe anſwered, <q>I have nothing upon my heart, except if you be pleaſed to have a little eye, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon the children, when God ſhall have taken me to himſelf. This I entreat of you ſimply,</q> as ſhe proceeded, <q>becauſe I find my ſelf inclined thereunto, and not

When we go to God, then we muſt ſet all things a ſide. God and the ſoul, and no more. Likewiſe I can tell you with an upright heart, that the only deſire which I have, is to go to my God &amp; to JESUS my Saviour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet proceeding on ſhe ſaid: <hi>Though I am very unworthy, yet he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to feel his holy reſt, and leads me to him without care</hi> That ſiſter ſaying to her, Then you doe depart in reſt, and you ſhall enter as with full ſail into the bleſſed haven of glory, into the boſom of the living God? ſo the anſwered: <hi>Yes,</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>my good Lord reacheth the hand to me. He will draw me, and give me the happineſs to arrive there I doubt not on it, I truſt on</hi> JESUS <hi>my Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that ſhe had been ſilent ſome time, ſhe began to pray &amp; to groan after the coming of God and JESUS
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34188:50"/>Chriſt to her, and turning her face ſhe ſaid: <q>My worthy ſiſter, pray fervently that my God may come, and that his good Spirit may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me to the end. Death is a way which is ſomething narrow, pray to the Lord Jeſus, that he may lead me through it. And a little after waxing fain, ſhe further ſaid, I beleeve that I ſhall thus ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of our ſiſters being then come to her bed, and talking with her about the happineſs of thoſe who die in the hands and love of Chriſt, ſhe ſaid to her very ſenſibly: <hi>I have earneſtly entreated the Lord Jeſus, that he would come, and he hath anſwered me. He cometh, and is come.</hi> And lifting up her arms, and clapping them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſhe went on, <hi>yea me thinketh I doe already embrace the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Yet then ſhe was in great diſtreſs, and endured much by reaſon of a generall convulſion of her ſinews. And this ſiſter, telling her, that ſhe ſuffered much, but that it was the way which we muſt paſſe to come to the Lord.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34188:50"/>Jeſus ſhe anſwered with a laughing mouth, which expreſſed the great contentment of her heart: <hi>O that is nothing at all, I doe much rejoyce at it: for all this bringeth me nearer to Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe from the beginning of this ſickneſs ſhe had a great impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God would take her to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the way of ſuffering: <q>O ſaid ſhe, ſuffering is ſo good to me, I have ſo much need of it; me thinketh, if an other of Gods children did ſuffer my pains, the ſame would bear them wholly after an other manner; yet however I muſt acknowledge, that the Lord Jeſus hath given me ſomething of his patience.</q> For he indeed it is, (as ſhe went on with an unſpeakable tenderneſs towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) it is he alone who giveth it to me, <q>I know that of my ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>God a little while after gave us that comfort as to ſee her all together, and to bleſs him for that ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he kept her. We came then to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34188:51"/>her, becauſe it did ſeem that even yet on that day ſhe was to paſſe over to the eternall manſion of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father.

We telling her that one of our ſiſters, who with the reſt could not come unto her, becauſe ſhe was ſick, did expect ſhortly to ſee her in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hoping that God likewiſe in a ſhort time would take her out of the world, ſo ſhe anſwerd very ſenſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and being wholly penetrated with that great happineſs which is in dying in the Lord: <hi>God grant her that grace.

But God ſo ordering it that I did ſpeak to her in the morning, ſhe then lifted up her

She did for two or three days ſeem to be much better then formerly. I had ſpoken with her on fry day, the day before her death, and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her of ſomthing which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her, which ſhe did receive with a humble heart, and a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and did practice it with

But it was within few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that God came to end it.

               <head>The generall diſpoſitions and laſt feelings of <hi>Mr. Dulignon,</hi> faithfull Paſtor of this Church.</head>
               <p>MASTER Dulignon, my very worthy Brother and faithfull fellow-labourer in the work of the Lord, was born at Marvegeols in the Province of Languedock of a father who loved him in a ſpeciall manner, &amp; ſpared nothing for his education, whether it was with him ſelf, or at Angouleme where he made him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his ſtudys, or at Saumur where he did continue the ſame, or in his journeys for Holland and England, from whence he came again to Paris, where he remained about two years. Beginning there to get an averſneſs to the world and train thereof, then he felt ſome inclination to the ſtudy of divinity, as being fit to draw him of from all affections to this age, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34188:54"/>to cauſe him to turn his thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven. Mr. Drelincourt, who had him in love and eſtimation did ſhew himſelf to be very glad for his reſolution, conceiving great hopes that it would tend to the good of Gods Church, if he gave himſelf to the building up of it. And his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave willingly his conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, though he had formerly other thoughts concerning this worthy ſon. All this made him reſolve to go to Geneva, where he thought to find more help to the end which be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to himſelf, and had then yet but a weak aim to it. As ſoon as he was come there, and had heard Mr. de Labadie, his heart was as captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſpeciall and unuſuall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he found in that Man of God. And even from that time he took his reſolution to put himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his overſight. And going to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him he deſired that he might dwell in his family: and ſo he came to his houſe, notwithſtanding the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations, which he had to other perſons and Miniſtres at Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34188:55"/>Even as the Lord had then all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought me to that place, and I dwelled with Mr. de Labadie, whom I have known and loved from my youth at Montauban, ſo my worthy Brother and I felt then firſt a tender and mutuall friendſhip to ariſe in our hearts, which the grace of God did ſanctify, and in ſucceſs of time did make ſo firm and perfect as might be ſeen, and which through his mercy ſhall never end.</p>
               <p>The cuſtoms of the world being very deeply rooted in the heart of my worthy Brother, they therefore were not ſo ſuddainly rooted out: but after divers great fits, he at the laſt gave him ſelf wholly up unto the Lord, and yeelded him ſelf upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his hands, denying himſelf with all his heart. Then we could firſt love one the other truly. And then likewiſe God made us one heart and one ſoul, through his Spirit and love. Divers of our friends had with us gotten a taſt in the truth of Chriſtian life, which Mr. de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badie did ſet forth with an admirable
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34188:55"/>force and with a light and purity which was fit to inlighten others, and to touch their heart, but they were not faithfull, and coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to them ſelves did return to the accuſtomed train of the world. But God, who in his goodneſs from my childhood had given me a lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his ſervice, and did much encreaſe the ſame whilſt I was at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, gave me that great comfort to be able to go to him in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this faithfull friend in whom he did work in ſuch a powerfull manner, and whom he did joyne together with me very nearly and intimately with his faithfull ſervant Mr. de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badie. We did ſo ſpend together the two laſt years of our ſtaying at Geneva, that our heart with reaſon, was much touched therewith, as often as we ſince that time have thought on it. The Lord was very good to us, and did vouchſafe to communicate him ſelf ſo to our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, that we owe him eternall thank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for his mercy and grace.</p>
               <p>M. de Labadie having done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34188:56"/>the reformation of Geneva during ſeven years time, all what his zeal and the extraordinary grace of God wherewith he was indowed did put him in mind, and to which it had ſet him on; and ſeeing how little reall fruit he gathered for the Lord, although great alterations did happen from time to time, and he was followed by a great concourſe of people, and was much regarded, and heard with much applaus; ſo he reſolved to accept of the call which he had to go to Middelborgh, which was ſent to him without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular expectation, although long before we had firmly beleeved and expected, that the Lord ſhould draw us out of Geneva, by the ways which him ſelf ſhould prepare thereunto. He then opening this way, we all three perfectly felt, (after we had oftentimes conſulted the Lord in prayer) that it came from him, and that it would be the way, whereby he would give us means that we might come to doe his work in theſe united Provinces. We

As for the reſt ſhe did much harden her ſelf againſt the word that the Lord cauſed to be offered to her, greeving very much the ſpirit of that faithfull ſervant of God, which did wholly burne with zeale for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and reparation of the Church, which he found in all places to be much decayed and deformed.</p>

The only difficulty which occurred, was that having no letpaſs but only for eighty perſons, ſo we ſhould have given occaſion by the encreaſe of the number, in popiſh places, which we were to paſs, to make an examination which might have discovered us. But God him ſelf took order therewith, even at that time when they were to depart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34188:58"/>in the letpaſs did remain intire. Having then changed our cloths, Mr. de Labadie, Mr. Dulignon, and I, with the break of day we went out of Geneva, and came to the veſſell of theſe good people, who did wait for us at the lake Leman about half an hour going from Geneva. We were there received with great love, although we were at the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the moſt of the perſons; but in time as they came to know that they had Mr. de Labadie in their company, they then were very glad for it. But they kept it always very ſecret. We went through divers dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in our paſſage through the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers cantons contrey which are of the Romiſh Religion, eſpecially at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsburgh and at Briſack; but the Lord delivered us out of all, and himſelf gave us opportunity to make a Church of our veſſell, and to be able therein to preach his word mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and evenings and more times of the day.

But God called us elſwhere. We then at the laſt came into theſe Provinces with Mr. Menuret, whom we had known and Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence cauſed us to meet at Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh.</p>
               <p>Being come to Utrecht where we were received with great affection, by Mr. Voetius, Mrs. Van Schur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and all her friends: then Mr. de Labadie did preſently proteſt that he was reſolved to have a warr with the world in his aſſembly at Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, preparing himſelf either to drive it out of the ſame, or elſe to be driven out of it by them.

                  </gap>y to hand with faithfulneſs and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34188:59"/>zeal, and the Lord gave us all a large field to labour in, both in publick and in particular for the welfare of ſouls and for the reformation of that poor Church, which the world had almoſt ſwallowed up. But all thoſe which would not hear any thing to be ſpoken of the reformation of life joyning together, and being afterwards aſſiſted by the walliſh Synod, wherewith we had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to do, and the laſt time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſs of Mr. Wolzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, ſo we had not a little to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in thoſe 4. years time whilſt we were in that place. In the mean while the Lord employed my worthy Brother in many things, as well in Holland as at Utrecht, and even here in Frieſland. And he made uſe of him for the good of his Work, and for the edification of many ſouls, whether at Rotterdam where he was much beloved by Mr. de Rochefort, and where having preached the word of the Lord for ſome time, the whole conſiſtory in the occaſion gave an authentick witneſs in his favour;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34188:59"/>or in a ſpeciall manner at the Hague, where he ſtayed frequently a long time, the Lord there bleſſing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly his word and converſation, even as alſo in other places, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it with the aſſiſtance of his grace, for the inſtruction and the help of many. God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having brought us to Amſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, and after divers great trials calling us alſo to Herfort, then he went to ſpeak to the Lady the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Elizabeth, to try her diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which ſhe ſhewed herſelf to be confirmed in a ſpeciall manner after ſhe had ſeen and ſpoken with our Brother, making it known to many what great ſatisfaction ſhe had in that which ſhe found in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God. When we were come to Herfort, then the Lord enlarged his grace and Spirit more and more in my worthy Brother, and did uſe him to his ſervice, whether it was in that place or whether it was again in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or at Altena by Hamborrow, where he did afterwards gather us all together, and did continue to powr
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34188:60"/>out his bleſſing upon our ſouls and aſſembly. When in that place the Lord had taken to himſelf his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant Mr. de Labadie, then I and my worthy Brother felt our ſelves as newly united again, and very narrowly bound, having never had the leaſt difference between us in the guidance of Gods work amongſt us. He came here in Frieſland to vew the place before we came over, and having ſtayed afterwards at Altena with a part of our aſſembly, ſo he followed us ſome time after for our mutuall comfort. And ſo it was here where firſt appeared that evill with which the Lord viſited him, to the glory of his Name and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his grace in a ſpeciall manner, at the end of his life.</p>
               <p>Having a very moiſt head, he was much incommodated by many ſharp defluctions, which formerly whilſt we were yet at Middleburgh, did uſe to fall upon his eyes even ſo farr as that he was like to looſe his ſight thereby; and afterwards divers times upon his heart: which did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34188:60"/>cauſe ſuddain faintneſs. And it ſeems that thoſe humors ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving changed their cours, did fall upon his chinne and there did form an evill, which divers did beleeve to be a ſort of canker, but which at the end was found to be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>He was therefore fain to ſuffer much pain; whether becauſe of the evill it ſelf, or by the very painfull cures which were uſed about it. The firſt was at Amſterdam, under the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of Doctor Helvetius, who dealt with him in much affection &amp; love, at the houſe of our worthy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. Bardewiſch, which was very glad to have him to ſtay with him as long as his cure ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
               <p>When they were come to an inſciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to begin the curing of his evill, which was done by Corroſives, he ſuffered all with very great patience, and at that time he did write to me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things that were very moving, of which I make no difficulty here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome extracts of them. Thus he uttered him ſelf about his ſtate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34188:61"/>Jannuary the 14. 1679. <q>If the Lord was not my ſtrength, I ſhould ſoon faile, but he doth not withdraw his goodneſs from me. He will continue the ſame to me, if it be his good pleaſure, to all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his will ſhall be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me in this my particular ſtate. The hand of the Lord is nothing at all hard, but contrarily is very ſoft towards me, and truly it is the hand of ſuch a father as our God is. He keepeth me by his grace prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all his divine will, and whatſoever he ſhall will, I hope of his infinite love, he will grant me to will the ſame with him, and to love it with all my heart. He hath ſhewed me very reall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his love, and as I did ſay but yeſterday, I feel that I am a ſinner whom he Loveth.</q> In his letter of the 17. are found theſe words: <q>It is a very reall comfort to be given up unto the will of the Lord, and in all things to depend on him. How lovely is that way, to leave one ſelf wholly unto him!
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34188:61"/>how neceſſary and comfortable! if ſouls oftentimes did know better what is to be found therein, they would not find ſo much trouble to go in it. But ſelf-love blindeth men, and maketh them moſt miſerable that ſuffer them ſelves to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith.</q> On the 20. he wrote to me theſe words: <q>That part which love maketh you to take in that which concerneth me, giveth me ſpeciall matter to praiſe and thank the Lord, and I pray to him to grant me that I may glorify him, for all his goodneſs towards me, the remaining part of my life, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the eternall praiſe and love which I wiſh to give him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he is infinitely worthy there of. The Lord maketh me from day to day to feel his ſoft hand, but I doe very well find that I muſt no leſs depend on his liberty, then at that time when this evill is moſt ſenſible to me. He can if he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it fit, yet again viſit me with it, and he might ſend me alſo a geater and more reall. He hath
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34188:62"/>all power over me, who have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nothing but his wrath.</q> On the 26. he did write with much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of heart, and with an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of humility, wherewith his heart was ſo full and ſo much pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated: <q>I am in ſome meaſure aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, my worthy Brother, that for ſuch a ſmall inconvenience, you doe all partake ſo much in that which I ſuffer. That tenderneſs moveth me much; but I feel before the Lord, that it paſſeth above what my condition is and requireth in his preſence, yet for as much as it pleaſeth him to give that heart, I therefore like and accept with love and thankfulneſs the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. This very thing is a fruit and iſſue of his goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me through his Children: and I thank him for it, even as I feel very well that I am thankfull to them for it, and eſpecially to my worthy Brother, who doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ſame ſo much to me. It is true till this time the Lord hath been pleaſed to keep me from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34188:62"/>time to time in ſome ſuffering, and perhaps his way will be to let me paſs through more of the ſame. It is alſo true that his hand, who hath prepared all this for me doth ſupport and ſtrengthen me by much goodneſs, cauſing me to love his way, and to have a will to glorify him therein. But ſurely, my worthy Brother, I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible before him that all things are very imperfect, &amp; very farr of from that which I owe him and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth from me. I am ſatisfied through his long-ſuffering and mercy in all my imperfections, eſpecially becauſe they are to me a particular cauſe to humble my ſelf under him. But he will have us to know well by experience that all our ſufficiency is from him, and that without him we can do nothing. he is not only the cauſe and ſupport of all the good which is in us, but he is alſo the perfection thereof. He will be all this in me &amp; all whatſoever more is neceſſary according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34188:63"/>in all whatſoever he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to the eternall glory of his Name.</q> The 28. I received from him a letter out of which I ſhall relate theſe following words which did ſhew that his cure was to continue, as alſo it did; <q>My dispoſition is not ſo well as it hath been for ſome days ſince, becauſe my pains have encreaſed my feavers, and have taken away much of the reſt which formerly I had, the Lord will leſſen the one and give the other as it ſhall pleaſe him. There is nothing to be ſaid about any thing that he doth, he be bleſſed for it for evermore. The cure of my accident is like to continue, if the Lord of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not ſhorten it. For as much as our ſiſter M. doth write to you hereof, I will ſay no more concerning it. I take part with the ſuffering of our ſiſter Y. And I wiſh that I may be able to ſhew it more particularly. But God, who is not only our ſupply but alſo our truth in all things, will alſo ſupply that want of the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34188:63"/>of my heart which I wiſh I could do to her. I entreat her that ſhe love his Dominion. He will not have us to bear the name of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in vain. He is our Lord and our King: We will call him ſo, and we do well for he is ſo. And that he cometh to us in all ſuch manner as he doth is to make us to have experience as well of the truth as of the loving-kindneſs of this his Dominion over us.</q> The 4. of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary he wrote unto me concerning his ſtate with theſe words: <q>what concerneth my condition I know not what to write unto you, but I feel very well that my cure, if God will be pleaſed to give it me, muſt come from him. Thoſe that labour about it do it with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the bleſſing muſt only come from him, without which nothing can be done. They have hitherto made uſe of corroſives, which have cauſed pain to me; but the hand of the Lord, which is likewiſe the hand of our Father, hath ſupported me. What concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34188:64"/>the future, I believe it muſt be much left to him, and as for me I well perceive, that it is his will that I muſt remain always in a totall reſignation of my ſelf to him: and that portion is much to be beloved. He is my God and likewiſe will be my good Father to all eternity according to his good pleaſure. This is enough to me. I am ſatisfied with all whatſoever his will ſhall be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me, if it pleaſeth him all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to continue to me that ſpirit and heart, as I hope this of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy.</q> He did write unto me the 7. of the ſame month: It pleaſeth <q>the Lord in ſmall things to inſtruct me much, whether it be in reſpect of him ſelf and of his wonderfull help, or in reſpect of my ſelf, to cauſe me to have experience how greatly and continually I have need of the Spirit of God without exception of any. But how tender is his love! How powerfull is his ſtrength! How lovely is his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs! How confirming is his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34188:64"/>preſence, and all his ways ſutable to his wiſdom and love, eſpecially when it pleaſeth him to let our ſouls ſee ſomthing of that wiſdom, wherein he beſtoweth all things on thoſe that are his, yea even to the leaſt thing. I do receive my leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, my worthy Brother, in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, even as the great Belevers and men of God have received theirs in greater ways, and in occaſions which were proportioned to the great meaſure of grace, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpeciall purpoſes of the Lord concerning them. I do however wiſh that in a ſpeciall manner I may praiſe him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning part of my life and for ever, for that which his mercy vouchſafeth to do in me, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me more concerning my ſelf and him. The ſame accidents which God ſendeth to the world and to his own, muſt certainly be looked upon intirely with an other eye in the one then in the other; and even as in the diſpenſing of them he hath quite differing aims,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34188:65"/>ſo likewiſe we muſt uſe &amp; receive them otherwiſe as men commonly do; the Lord having no other aim in his deſignes about thoſe that are his, but to do them more good, and to make them more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him that he may have more his divine pleaſure in them.</q> On the 14. he uttered this truth in one of his letters: <q>I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been touched herewith, that as the Lord hath cauſed us lively to feel, that as it was his will we ſhould ſee nothing but him in the way of loving-kindneſs &amp; light, wherein he hath cauſed us to walk a long time; he would likewiſe teach us, not to ſee nor will any thing but him in the way of any ſuffering he doth ſend to us. And indeed he is no leſs in this laſt as in the former. Yea he cauſeth many times ſuch a true &amp; pure joy to be found therein, that all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment can not be compared therewith.</q> On the 21. He did write to me theſe following words, <q>Our ſtate is reaſonably well by the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34188:65"/>goodneſs of the Lord, and he hath ſhewed the ſame to me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular very much, having ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me during thoſe pains, which thus farr have been neceſſary for the curing of my evill, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening me when they are but a little leſs, and not bringing upon me ſuch heavy feavers which by their continuance according to their ordinairy courſe would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have brought me down. But it is the loving-kindneſs of this good Phyſitian &amp; Father, whom I muſt acknowledge, and for which I muſt thank him. What concerns my accident in particular, they took of a cruſt yeſterday, which was made by the corroſive, and ſeeing it was very thick, they think that it is gone pretty deep towards the bottom of the evill. The Lord who doth direct &amp; diſpoſe all things according to his mind &amp; good pleaſure, will put an end to it, when it ſhall pleaſe him, if his divine will be ſo. He maketh us to love his will, which cauſeth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34188:66"/>our ſeparation according to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to continue longer, then hath been thought, but I hope he will give ſo much the more comfort, when his good hand will cauſe all meet together again. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the condition of our ſick to his love, and I pray to him that through the ſame he may bleſs them in all what he ſendeth unto them. Likewiſe the ſtate of the ſouls of all the brethren and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether thoſe that are nearer by or further of, toucheth me ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and I pray Likewiſe to the author of that great mercy which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34188:66"/>that we may purely poſſeſs the ſame. I pray to the Lord with all my heart, that he may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let this ſenſe go into the ground of my heart, and as into the marrow of every one of thoſe whom his love will give to us, even as alſo of thoſe whom his love hath already given to us. There are indeed few lamps, which burn in the preſence of God, or which be in ſtate to burn throug the good &amp; pure Spirit, and if the Lord in ſome meaſure doth grant us that benefit, what doe not we owe to this love? I doe greet with much tenderneſs all the Church of the Lord which he hath formed amongſt us, and as many he calleth thereunto, and thoſe who do endeavour to pleaſe him, and to ſerve him in truth. And although I do not name them by name, yet they are not therefore leſs preſent to me in my ſpirit, and the condition of each of them doth nothing the leſs go to my heart.</q> After this cure had continued long, and my worthy

I have no more pain on it, and it ſeemeth that the Lord will end all things through his goodneſs. He grant me of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy that I may live wholly a new life to his glory, and to the glory of Jeſus Chriſt his beloved Son, my Saviour &amp; King to all eternity,</q>

               <p>He had divers times an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on to write a common letter to thoſe whom the Lord in his love hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to us, and in his Houſe doth keep gathered under his overſight, giving us hope that he will fully u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them with this his Houſe and Body.

               <p>
                  <q>My beloved brethren and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have oftentimes had a mind to write unto you, to give you ſome ſpeciall witneſs of that holy love which God hath laid in our hearts for your ſouls, but the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hindered it ſometimes by the diſeaſe wherewith he hath been pleaſed to viſit me, I therefore have thought that his Spirit provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in all things through himſelf in thoſe who have received him, and that he alſo hath granted you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly to be led and helped in the way of the Lord which he hath made to you, by my worthy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your faithfull paſtor. So I have thus farr contented my ſelf as to let you know with how much tenderneſs I am mindfull of you,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34188:68"/>and to pray the Lord that it may pleaſe him to continue his mercy to you, and to multiply that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace which he ſheweth to you together with us, that is in truth and only to ſeek his divine Face. And I hope that he hath not rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that prayer which in my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I was inclined to make for your ſouls. He is good, and taketh pleaſure in the leaſt groan which his Spirit formeth in us to his glory. I likewiſe have deſired to admoniſh you in his love that you ſhould wholly and for all things truſt on him, we are but to pray for his grace that the ſpirit of his glory may ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate us and lead us in all things. And ſhould he deny us that which his Spirit and love maketh us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for his own ſake? That can not be: for he is unchangeably faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Love which he hath for himſelf, and for all that which thereof he powreth out into our hearts, to make us to draw near to him. Make account above all things of that good to know him ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34188:68"/>as he cauſeth himſelf to be known to you. For there is great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the earth, and perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

My belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it is very ſeldom that one ſhall hear a word of pure truth, and if one cometh to heare any it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakly and little in the ſpirit. Let this go lively into your hearts, even as it ought to touch us all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and to make us fear. Truly the Lord is good to our ſouls, and we have great matter to humble our ſelves before him, and to be aſhamed he vouchſafing to give us to partake of the pure grace of his beloved Son, and to place us in the holy ways of his pure and true ſervice. Let the greatneſs and purity of the calling whereof you are made partakers, pull you yet more out of your ſelves, and exalt you above all thinghs, It is from God, and it

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:34188:69"/>Jeſus went with great ſteps to the croſs to die for us, and how ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do we go to the place where we ſhall find life!

Allthough now for ſome time I have not had the comfort of ſeeing your faces, yet however, I have ſome times felt, beholding you in the Spirit, that the Lord hath been well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with you, and that he would multiply his grace and mercy to you from day to day. But belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved brethren and ſiſters, muſt not we ſeek the ſame in a ſpirit wholly new? And will we be wearied to love the ſame, and to walk there by? The Spirit which maketh them to be found every day ſo lovely is a new Spirit given to that end, and he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe worketh new things in thoſe that have received him. I pray you
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34188:70"/>beloved be not caſt down about any thing, that you may not grow faint in the way which the Lord hath made to us: for he will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us unto all things through the holy Spirit of his ſtrength: and if through his love for him, we are indeed willing to be ſtrong, the weakeſt ſhall have ſo much given to him that neither the fleſh, nor the world, nor the hell ſhall be able to overcome him. Be faithfull to ſuffer your ſelves to be humbled and broken, through the Spirit of truth and purity which the Lord cauſeth you to feel, and through which he ſpeaketh unto you, and preſſeth you with love. There is no life of Chriſt in us but ſo far as we are dead to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves; and his Spirit doth not purely enlarge it ſelf but after that our own Spirit is denied and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

My former diſeaſe hath been accompanied with much ſweetneſs, and I can hardly ſee any other thing therein. You likewiſe, and others with me have found how good it is to be and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under his hand, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to keep us under it; let our little experience teach us more that obedience which we owe him, &amp; let it make us to draw nearer to him, ſeeing he vouchſafeth to come to us in ſo much love, then even when he cometh to us to make us to ſuffer any thing.

Thoſe good hearts and that good Spirit, which the Lord giveth to thoſe that are his, are to much inclined to feel all what is of the communion of thoſe who are united in God and in Chriſt, then that they ſhould fail in the dutys of love which do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them.

               <p>The Lord at that time having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored my very Worthy Brother, gave him opportunity to go to Rotterdam, and to the Hague, and to Utrecht to ſatisfy the deſire of divers; after which in his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Providence, he brought him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to us, to our mutuall and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall comfort. Even as he did very tenderly love his ſheep, ſo likewiſe was he tenderly beloved by them, and he feeling a ſpeciall love towards me, ſo I felt likewiſe ſuch a great full and inward agreement of heart with him, that I can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſame, even as this is known to God, and hath appeared before his Children amongſt us. So that we thanked the Lord together for that mutuall conſolation which he gave to us, and which did very ſenſibly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate us to him. His zeal for Gods glory and the ſalvation of ſouls was greater and more lively then ever, and he applyed himſelf with much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34188:75"/>feeling of heart to the making of our <hi>great Catechiſm or Chriſtian inſtruction,</hi> which came out in print a few days before the Lord took him out of this world into his eternall glory. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed him wholly anew to the cure of his worthy flock, edifying them by word, example and guidance, and together with me providing for them all neceſſary help, which his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king love did incline him without ceaſing to afford them. But before the ſommer was wholly paſt, we ſaw his evill to grow again, by the falling down of the ſame humors, and it did encreaſe even ſo much, that it was judged to be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to come to a totall extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We endeavoured to have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chirurgent to come from the Hague, which had ſhewed love to us, but the providence of God not permitting him to come, ſo it was the deſire of my Worthy Brother, after he had taken counſell about it with our Doctor (who hath ſhewed to him even to his end a very tender and unuſuall affection) that one of our

               <p>After that the evill was cut out, my Worthy Brother not being in ſtate for to ſpeake, would yet in the midſt even of his greateſt and moſt lively pain utter out ſome words to tell us, <hi>That the Lord was good and very good: that we ſhould thank him, and more then he himſelf; and that we ſhould pray to the Lord, if he did put it into our hearts, that in his mercy he would take him to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A few days after we found the wound to be yet in a very ſlight ſtate, and that much of the evill was yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. For even as it was not cloſed up in its ſkin ſo it had ſpread it ſelf much abroad, and was gone a great deale further as one could well beleeve, or judge from without. Yet the wound which was made was very deep; the pains which our worthy Brother muſt therefore ſuffer have been very ſenſible &amp; of long
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34188:77"/>continuance; his weakneſs was great, and the hope of taking the evill quite away by cutting or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was but little. All this made us to conclude, that we were to cut no more, the Patient being in no condition to ſuffer it; although on the other ſide we likewiſe ſaw that unleſs the Lord ſhould extend his helping hand in an extraordinary manner, we ſhould in a ſhort time be deprived of our worthy Brother, after he ſhould have endured yet much pain. The Doctor was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly greeved for it &amp; was wounded in his heart: but the Lord, who gave us more then ever to take our refuge unto him, did ſupport our hearts by Faith, and by the hope which he gave to us upon his almighty hand. When I ſaid unto my very worthy Brother what we judged of his ſtate, he ſaid, <hi>Every will of God is good;</hi> and not being able to ſpeake more by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his wound, ſo he cauſed them to give him a writing table, on which he did write theſe words: <q>By the Grace of God, I wiſh not to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34188:77"/>live here below, but I am very willing to go to him, and give my ſelf over to his mercy from whom I expect all. But now I ſhould be able to ſay nothing elſe, but that the power of God is able to reſtore all things, and I feel ſome joy in my mind that I do as more fall into his divine hands.</q> A little after he added theſe words, <q>I ſhould nor be willing to neglect any thing which the providence of God doth offer to me, for it is the token of his will and of his work; but God doing all things as he doth, that is as I think, to make me to looſe and find my ſelf more in him. Perhaps he will likewiſe have me more to ſee the end of humane power, to ſhew us what he is to us in his love when it pleaſeth him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Siſter Huyghens ſpeaking to him of his apparent death, ſo he ſaid, <hi>We will follow the Lamb whetherſoever it f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34188:78"/>of humility whereof he was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very full, <hi>I am weak, and ſtrong: weak in myſelf, and ſtrong in God; and more then I can ſay.</hi> The two next inſuing days the wounds did grow worſe and worſe, ſo that all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of healing did by degrees more and more vaniſh away. But the Lord did put into the heart of our brother that had him in cure, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him a certain oile, which might do no hurt to the wound but much good, if it ſhould pleaſe God to give his bleſſing to it. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy did in few days ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the evill, and almoſt without pain, or it did rather ſo vaniſh away, by the powerfull and efficacious will of the Lord, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſeen of it, and the wound was put into ſo good a ſtate, as one might wiſh. The Lord would thus ſhew us what he is able to do when it pleaſeth him; and that when he doth not the things, it is not becauſe they are to hard or not to be done, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not his time or well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him.</p>

               <p> When my worthy Brother did run the greateſt danger, then one of our brethren had expreſſed in a ſong the ſtate and diſpoſitions of our heart in relation to him, and likewiſe thoſe of the heart of our beloved patient, even as that may be ſeen in our ſpirituall ſongs in french, in page 178.

               <p>The wound by Gods bleſſing viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly running together, was at the laſt cloſed up by the laſt hand which he himſelf did put to it, ſo that my worthy Brother was thereby not ſo much as hindred in his ſpeech, and had again the means to be able by his words to edify the Houſe of the Lord, even as he had done ſo much by his manyfold ſufferings, and by the heart which therein he ſhewed, to the glory of his Grace who gave it him. If I ſhould tell you all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever about this great matter the

               <p>I have found among his papers a writing, which I do believe he made a little after that the Lord had perfectly healed him.

The Lord who giveth to me this feeling, which I love and will cloſe up in my heart, will by his divine fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger engrave it therein, not only to continue to me the remembrance thereof, but by his Grace to be faithfull to it, if he will keep me yet ſometime in this life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After that the all-powerfull and all-good hand of our heavenly Father had thus even as miraculouſly reſtored him, ſo he ſpoke to all his ſheep in ſuch a pure and heart ſtirring manner in the Aſſembly, that it did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear that there was come even
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34188:86"/>as a new life in his ſoul, and that the love of God and of his glory, of Chriſt and of his Kingdom, of the Church and all his Elect did more then ever burn in his heart, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there more lively and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly flames to ariſe. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did by letters to many ſhew the ſenſe of thankfulneſs, wherewith he did a new bind himſelf to God and to his ſervice, at the ſame time when he by an inward and upright humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did count himſelf unworthy to be again employed thereto by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and his holy Providence. Of all thoſe letters which he did write about this, and whereof we could find co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pys I ſhall relate but two, which ſhew the ſpirit wherewith he was wholly poſſeſſed. The one was to Mr. Bardewiſch and his wife who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tender love which they had for him, did greatly partake with him in his ſtate, and in the danger wherein he had been: And the other to my mother in which he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth divers moving and pure feelings, which without doubt will be deſired
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34188:87"/>to be ſeen. The firſt was of the 23. of February of the year 1680 laſt paſt in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My worthy Brother and my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Siſter, you have been ſad and comforted for me, God having been pleaſed to make you partakers with me in all whatſoever it hath pleaſed him to ſend to me, and it is fit that I ſhould ſhew you how that I have not been unſenſible of your love, and that whilſt I thank you in his love, I doe likewiſe invite you to praiſe him with me. It would be little if we ſhould but partake of that which mutually doth concern us, if we did not yet more narrowly partake in giving thanks for the ſame to him, who ſending to thoſe that are his all things for good, will alſo be praiſed and thanked for the ſame by them all. I am to ſmall and to weak, to be able to acknowledge as is fit the leaſt of his benefits, which he hath ſhewed to me in this his laſt viſitation; but however I will praiſe him for it by his grace a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l the days of my life. And join your
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34188:87"/>ſelves to me, if you pleaſe, to pay to him with me this holy duty. It is indeed beſt for thoſe to whom God hath manifeſted himſelf in his grace, to depart out of this life as changing houſe, for to be with Chriſt, who is given to them for a Saviour and Head, but in the order of thoſe benefits, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon thoſe that are his in this warfare, he is willing that we ſhould thankfully acknowledge all the help which he giveth in thoſe divers ſtates wherein it pleaſeth him to place us: eſpecially when they are accompanied with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his love, to make himſelf ſenſible to our ſouls, and to cauſe even all what he hath ſent to us, to turn to ſuch a great good as is that of our greater ſanctification and communion with Chriſt. I hope of his mercy that he will cauſe me to draw ſome ſuch fruit out of all that which is paſt. I doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all from that love which I have oftentimes found and felt to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; and likewiſe I am very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34188:88"/>to witneſs it, that giving ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

He by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Grace hath granted me to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go to him for ever, to long for him as for my God to whom I have conſecrated my ſelf; but he hath yet been pleaſed to deferr the accompliſhment of his mercy to my ſoul, and yet would make me to find that the ſame was very great in all what he hath done for me. But what ſhall I ſay? In all what he doth, whether he doth it or doth it not, he is always good, and knoweth how to make himſelf to be felt and found that he is infinitely lovely. Praiſe him with me for this my worthy brother and ſiſter, and for as much as you likewiſe in your own perſons have tryed his faithfull care for you, let us all ſay one with an other in a lively ſenſe of what he is, that his loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34188:88"/>is great, and continueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. His holy Name be bleſſed for all things. Let Jeſus be very much beloved, and praiſed by the ſouls of us all; and that good Spirit of God, which hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to take us under his conduct, and who doth ſtrengthen us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, and raiſeth us up again, and cauſeth us to rejoyce in that ſteadfaſt hope that once we ſhall ſee him, he alſo be bleſſed and adored for evermore. It hath pleaſed the Lord wholly to cloſe up that which was remaining of my wound, ſo that nothing elſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, but that I faithfully thank him for all what he hath done, and that I keep my ſelf buſy in his love, to make that holy uſe which I ought to make of that life which he hath as newly given to me again. But he will alſo grant me this grace, beſides all thoſe others that I have need of, that I may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the offering of my ſelf which I have made to him for ever. It is good to live for him, and yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34188:89"/>to die in him, to enjoy with him his eternall life. Our worthy Siſter Huyghens hath made us clearly to ſee, that which his Spirit giveth us to beleeve. We doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taſte it, and have triall of it, ſo much as the Lord pleaſeth to give us; but ſhe hath cauſed us at leiſure to ſee that grace which God beſtoweth upon thoſe that are his, and to heare, taſte, and feel it. And he doth undoubtedly give us ſuch appearances of his faithfull and mighty love, that our hearts may enlarge themſelves in him, and that by a more full yeelding of our ſelves over into his hands, he may more poſſeſs us. Worthy Brother and Siſter, let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more then before at any time be our King and only Poſſeſſor. Let us live to him, and not live but for him, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q>

               </p>
               <p>For as much as his evill did viſibly grow worſe, and no time was to be loſt if he was yet to paſs over into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, ſo the French Chyrurgent, whereof I have ſpoken, came to him the ſecond time to ſee him at Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and having given more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment then at firſt, ſo my worthy Brother conſented to the importunate entreaty which was made to him, that he ſhould put himſelf under his cure; and the froſt coming in, and not ſuffering a longer delay he went in a barge to the Hague, there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what ſhould be the Lords laſt will about him. My worthy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did then write unto me: <q>If this is the way by which the Lord
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34188:97"/>will lead me to death, it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be the way to go to him for whom I long: and I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible through his grace that this would be the full meaſure of his mercy towards me, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the deſires which the Lord through his good Spirit hath put in the bottom of my heart. Fare well my very worthy Brother whom I do embrace with my whole heart, and with you all our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Brethren and Siſters, and the called of the Lord, to whom I wiſh all bleſſing and increaſe of grace, even as likewiſe all the children, whom I do all embrace in this Spirit without exception.</q> The Lord made us then in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner to humble our ſelves before him filling us with that ſenſe which was expreſſed in the words of Chriſt in the garden Gethſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſs by: if not thy will be done:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we did diſcours the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time when we were aſſembled, ſubmitting our ſelves with the heart
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34188:97"/>to what his hand ſhould find good to do with our worthy Brother, whom we gave up to him, and put him anew into his hands. Hereupon as weak as he was he wrote to me theſe words: <q>Having underſtood that the Lord hath inclined your hearts to humble your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him for my ſake, who am a fit ſubject for it, ſo I have felt almoſt the ſame of that which God hath cauſed you to experience about his grace and divine preſence: and following the ſteps of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit I find my ſelf in a reall and more then ordinary diſpoſition, to lay my ſelf down with his Church, and in ſome meaſure more then ſhe at his divine feet. Both the words concerning which you have ſpoken, have touched me very much, &amp; the laſt words of the Lord Jeſus, are ſome times thoſe whereby my heart goeth to God his Father and to him. The Lord who by his H. Spirit hath moved your hearts thus to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves, will alſo be pleaſed with the ſmell of your prayers for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34188:98"/>his Sons ſake. I pray to him and thank him with all my heart, that whilſt he keepeth me in a very ſimple frame, and as one of his creatures, which ſuch as it is hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf over into his hands. He giveth me a very reall ſenſe of his preſence, and I can not but expect all things from his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whatſoever it ſhall pleaſe him to do.</q> A little while after I did write unto him that his wife our worthy Siſter was in extraordinary weakneſs, whom the Lord with him did cauſe to draw near to her diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even as we have ſeen in that writing which containeth her laſt words and diſpoſitions, and about this he wrote to me theſe words: <q>I had not expected that which you have written to me concerning the weakneſs of my Siſter. It hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſibly touched my heart. But the Lord having made me to behold it in him, it gave me preſently to adore him, and to give all over to him in that ſpirit which the knowledge and love of him doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34188:98"/>of us. And in that as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, he hath made me to find, that through his grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us he is indeed all to us; and that in the ground we are nothing, nor will any thing, but in and for him. I know not whether he hath fullfilled his will whereof he hath given much likely hood. If it hath pleaſed him ſo to do it is without giving me as yet any particular feeling thereof. yet I do not ſtay there. And through his goodneſs I do adore, praiſe, and thank him, that his mercy towards his daughter and handmaid ſhould be accompliſhed, to his glory and our common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and in the good ſavour of the grace of the Lord Jeſus. I have loved her, and yet do love her if ſhe be yet a mongſt us, with a love more tender and worthy of God then I ever did before. But if God of his infinite love hath made her to put of all remainders of mortality and imperfection, taking her to him ſelf, then I feel that I love her whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34188:99"/>with an other love, and ſuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with that ſtate wherein ſhe ſhould be. In the mean while, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we underſtand more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the way of God towards her, we ſhall endeavour to continue in the ſpirit of compliance, adoration, and embracing of every will of God both towards her and towards us all.</q> In the following letter I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted my worthy Brother that God in his love had taken her to him ſelf, with ſo much edification &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as the Lord did it. And he wrote unto me the affections of his heart in theſe words: <q>I have properly nothing to do but to praiſe and thank God, about that which he hath been pleaſed to do in my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wife, whom he was pleaſed to take to him ſelf. So much as his Spirit and providence hath made me to be near related to her, ſo much doth the ſame Spirit oblige me through his grace towards her to praiſe him, to acknowledge his work, to comply with it, and to love it with all my heart. and I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34188:99"/>likewiſe thank the ſame good and faithfull Spirit, that it may pleaſe him to work this in me. The work of God is good and beautifull, and I ſee nothing in it but what muſt make it all the remaining part of my life precious, lovely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. The Lord hath enlarged the ground of his Spirit in his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, at the leaſt in ſome meaſure. For I know and feel even as God many times by his Spirit hath made me to ſee, that there were yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other propertys of his grace and ſtrength wholly lovely in her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he giveth them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to certain ſimple and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſouls. But he hath cauſed his mercy towards her, and the divine fruitfullneſs and vertue which is in thoſe who have well received his Spirit, to appeare ſo much, that I have nothing but to praiſe the Lord for what be hath done. He doth not ſuffer me to have an other mind about it, and although there is ſomething ſenſible which tranſient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth preſent it ſelf to me, upon
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34188:100"/>the remembrance that ſhe is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I can not forbear to acknowledge, yea and witneſs the lively ſenſe which I have of the love which you, and divers brethren and ſiſters in a ſpeciall manner, and the whole Church in generall have ſhewed to her.</q> In an other letter he did yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain utter to me what in ſucceſs of time did touch him about this matter, in theſe words: <q>I continue by the goodneſs of the Lord to feel the great good which he hath done to his handmaid and daughter, and whereof it hath pleaſed him to cauſe ſomething to iſſue down upon us, but eſpecially upon me: which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth me all my life-time to praiſe and thank him as in a ſpeciall ſenſe of the ſpirit.

And although the ſenſe thereof is not always one and the ſame, yet their truth is ſo reall and efficacious, that they do never preſent themſelves to the ſoul, who is wont to feel them, without leaving in her always a lively and divine impreſſion. I hope that the Lord will make my worthy Siſter always in ſome ſort preſent to me, according to this holy truth in his grace and glory. I leave her gladly and heartily in the boſom of her true and eternall Bride-groom in which ſhe reſteth, poſſeſſing him and being poſſeſſed of him. It is enough to me, if the Lord ſhall be pleaſed, that I may be able to behold him in her by his Spirit, from time to time, and her in him, according to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable unity, which maketh them perfect, in one. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God towards her is likewiſe a ſpeciall reaſon to me for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

                  </gap> give up his ghoſt in the midſt of us, if it was the will of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And likewiſe on the other ſide ſeeing that there was no perfect cure to be expected, he wiſhed that he might have ended here the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his tranſitory life. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſome times this hope, as he wrote, when the Lord at the laſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the water and ſeemed to give means for his tranſportation. But it was not but only to bring over his body without life, and ſeparated from his ſoul, which did reſt with Chriſt Jeſus in the happy boſom of his glory, before his body was brought here to reſt, in the place where thoſe of the other Children of the Lord were laid: which he inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently did ſignify to be his deſire,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34188:108"/>whilſt likewiſe he left it fully to the Lord to do there with as he ſhould think fit, and to his Children to do what God ſhould put in their hearts, and according as his holy Providence ſhould permit.</p>
               <p>The Lord having already cauſed him to give a great and manyfold witneſs of his grace and the goodneſs of his ways towards him, he found good at the end, and whilſt my worthy Brother was at the Hague, for the moſt part to keep him in a ſtate of ſilence or ſpeaking little, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten a dry cough, and which was very incommodious to him as ſoon as he ſpoke, conſtraining him as wholly to gather himſelf together within himſelf before God, and to conſume himſelf in ſilence and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of heart as a lamb upon Gods altar, or as a burning lamp which did breath out all her ſtrength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to God and to Jeſus his King and Saviour. Which did not hinder but that from time to time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained himſelf to utter, as there was opportunity, that which he felt of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34188:109"/>God, of his love, and of his holy Myſterys <q>Which, once he ſaid, were ſo lively and purely printed upon his heart by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, as if they were there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in great and very legible letters. He added there to, I knew before the ſame truths by education, and afterwards by ſtudy; but all what God doth not imprint by his Spirit is inſtable, and may be overturned witha ſhadow.</q> Upon an other occaſion he ſaid, <q>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a very eſſentiall grace; it is better then all raptures of the ſenſes.</q> He ſaid to one who came to viſit him in his great weakneſs, <q>Our breath indeed is between our lips, and it is the Lord truly that keepeth it there.</q> This perſon ſpeaking to him of the ſtudy of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in reſpect of the office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſaid unto him very ſenſibly: <q>There is need of a ſpeciall grace, and afterwards of a calling from God, and then yet God muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under ſuch a burden. For the decay of the Church is much come
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34188:109"/>from thence that men without the Spirit, and thoſe which have not been called thereunto of the Lord, have been brought upon the pulpit. He added to it, It is certain if one doth well conſider what this holy office doth require, and God not giving ſpeciall meaſures of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that in ſteed of addicting one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereunto, one ſhould rather go and dwell in a wood or a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even as divers holy men have formerly done.</q> And there upon he told him ſomething which he had known and practiſed by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, untill the Lord had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to follow and to ſerve him in the work of the miniſtery, which he had laid upon him for his Kingdom and for his glory.</p>
               <p>That day he ſpoke ſomething more then ordinarily, but he found him ſelf much wearied in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being taken with a generall cold and much weakneſs. And as they would give him ſomething for his refreſhment and to paſs the night the better, he ſaid: <q>Muſt one do

But becauſe his arm being already grown ſtiff, he brought his hand higher then his mouth, and had need to have it to be directed.

O what love is it, that Jeſus draweth near to us, and at the laſt receiveth us into his glory!</hi> Not being able to proceed, by reaſon of his weakneſs that overwhelmed him, and which did cauſe him to draw near to his full deliverance, and one of our Siſters telling him, that a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love beſides a power of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did take him away to God, he then nodded with his head that it was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34188:115"/>ſo, and inforcing himſelf, he ſpoke yet theſe words, <hi>Let the Lord do.</hi> Where upon ſtretching himſelf out, he fell a ſleep a little while after, in the arms of the Lord ſleeping the ſleep of the righteous, entering into that eternall reſt which God hath prepared for his favourites, and from that time enjoying that eternall and unchangeable joy, where with the Lord Jeſus hath decreed in his unſpeakable love to fill all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants.

                  </gap>he was much bent and inclined unto thoſe means which God made uſe of to inlighten her and to touch her heart. She was more faithfull then her Maſter and Miſtris, and went before them in the way of the Lord, who themſelves took pain to keep her at Rotterdam when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to Herfort, and ſhe found her ſelf inwardly preſſed to come there. God made uſe of one perſon, who diſpoſed her Miſtris ſo as to let her go; who ſhortly after him ſelf was to her a hinderance &amp; temptation beſides others. But nothing was able to move her, nor to diſturb her. She ſaid, <hi>The whole world ſhall not be able to hold me. I find not only feet to go thither, but alſo wings to fly.</hi> Now being come to Herfort God did work ſo viſibly and powerfully in her ſoul, that the work of Chriſt did quickly manifeſt it ſelf in her, ſo that in teſtimony
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34188:120"/>thereof in a little time we acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her for a member of his Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. Her zeal made her unti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſervice of God, and of his Children. Nothing was painfull to her. Nothing was to much to her; and that was ſeen in her which once a holy man ſaid concerning pure love, <hi>That ſhe doth not know what painfulneſs &amp; heavineſs is, that ſhe can not endure the name thereof, and will not have a man to ſpeak of it.</hi> Her readineſs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very will of God was very ſpeciall. Sometimes in ſuch occaſions which were ſome trials, ſhe ſaid: <hi>every will of the Lord is good, and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> She did frequently enjoy a great peaceableneſs of mind, and an unſpeakable truly heavenly joy. The Lord diſpoſed it ſo that ſhe was one of the firſt amongſt us who was to make a journy for Holland. And for as much as at that time the world and evill men were as enraged againſt that work which God through his grace did form amongſt us, therefore on that ſide we had not a little to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as alſo of many who being helt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34188:120"/>for pious and good, were poſſeſſed with a blind and bitter zeal againſt that which they knew not, or even would not know. But God ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened her in a ſpeciall manner, and made her to ſtand faſt againſt all. Her friends would not ſuffer her to diſpoſe of her goods, which ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, ſuffered them to keep the ſame without looking any more after them: and ſo ſhe returned to the place where her heart was, and where God in ſuch aſpeciall manner had cauſed her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory, as ſhe did write in a letter to one of her friends. And becauſe afterwards ſhe went with great paces forward to wards the mark of her heavenly calling, it was told her in one of our <hi>examinations,</hi> that the Lord prepared her for to enjoy much communion with him: which God did quickly afterwards fulfill, tranſlating her into his heavenly Kingdom. She was taken with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry burning hot fever, when we were yet at Herfort, which took her away in few days. She did ſuffer with much love, and referring of her ſelf
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34188:121"/>to the will and pleaſure of God. <hi>It is the Lords will,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and likewiſe mine.</hi> And perceiving that the Lord drew near, then ſhe ſaid with great joy: <hi>I am paſſing over unto life; ſhould not I then rejoyce?</hi> She had much in her heart and mouth the words of one of our ſongs,<note place="margin">In a book called Holy Songs p. <hi>90.</hi>
                  </note> in which the ſoul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to God thus:</p>

               <p>The ſenſe of her ſins which God had given to her, whether they were thoſe which ſhe had committed in the ways of the world, or in the ways of thoſe that are ordinarily devout, was oftentimes very lively preſent with her. But her truſt in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and her burning love towards him conſumed all. And in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſhe went over to him, being about 24. years old, that ſhe might for ever be united with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In the month of Aprill.</note>The ſecond perſon whom God through his grace hath taken up into his glory, was our Brother Laurence
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34188:121"/>Autein, born at Paris in France, but who lived for the moſt part at Middleburgh in Sealand. He was a book-binder by his trade, and from his youth he had endeavoured to ſerve God in ſome uprightneſs of heart. One of our Brethren by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Lord coming to his ſhop and ſpeaking with him, his heart was touched there by, and feeling himſelf drawn to give him ſelf wholly over to the Lord, we therefore a little while after at his earneſt requeſt took him into our houſe, being aſſured in himſelf that there he ſhould find great helps and means to live unto God, in that faithfulneſs which his Spirit requireth and his word preſcribeth to us. His naturall diſpoſition was ſomething diſadvantagious to him and did give him oftentimes trouble. But the Lord granting to him much faithfulneſs of heart, and a lively ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt that which is evill, with an inward deſire that in all things he might pleaſe God, yet not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he continued ſteadfaſt unto the end in his way, and was always a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34188:122"/>comfort to us. He loved the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God with a tender love, and was very faithfull, and gave ſtrictly heed to all what was committed unto him, being carefull of that which was of the Lord truly through his love. And for as much as he was as yet to ſtay at Amſterdam, with two of our Brethren, when we went for Herfort, he afterwards received the comfort to come to us and to enjoy communion with this body of Chriſt, whereof his grace had made him a true member: but a waſting and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ague, which turned into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, did not long afterwards take him out of this world. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt of us were to dwell at Zonderen, being a contry-houſe near by Herfort, he was deſirous to be brought thither, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his weakneſs: and being come thither he was very glad that he might die in the midſt and as it were in the arms of thoſe with whom God had made him one heart and one ſoul both for time and eternity. And likewiſe God did ſoon hear his deſire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34188:122"/>him from all his ſufferings he tranſlated him eternally into his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reſt.</p>
               <p>The third perſon, whom God took from the midſt of us to him whilſt we were yet at Zonderen, was our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Samuell Spikershoff, of middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, a Baker by his trade, he had been as yet a little while amongſt us, when the Lord took him away: yet this happened not untill he had done his work in him in a very viſible and ſpeciall manner. Our brother D. his brother in law, having ſpoken with him divers times, at middle-burgh of the work of the Lord among us, he felt thereunto ſuch an inward inclination, that he could not ſtay ſo long till his Brother in law was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, who likewiſe was about to come over with his houshold to us. God alſo by the effect did ſhew that his time was ſhort, ſeeing he took him to himſelf before his ſiſter and brother in law were come to us. As for him the zeal which he ſhewed to come thither, and the joy which he felt at his departure were not to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34188:123"/>Day and night he was full of this deſire, and the hope which he had that God would cauſe himſelf to be found of him in the midſt of his Children, and to communicate him ſelf to him, by thoſe ſpeciall means which in his love he gave amongſt them, this did even tranſport him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond himſelf, and out of all other things. On this ſubject he did often times ſing with a lively feeling of heart the words of David Pſalm 27.</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>My heart would faint but that in me,<note place="margin">I had ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if I ha not be ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that I ſchould ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living.</note>
                     </l>
                     <l>This hope is fixed faſt:</l>
                     <l>The Lord Gods good grace ſhall I ſee,</l>
                     <l>In life that aye ſhall laſt.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>God did hear the deſire of his ſoul, and in his good Providence did bring him to Herfort, where preſently he came to his heart to do his work there in, to the great comfort of us all. The inclination which he had to that which God did amongſt us, had already begun to draw of his heart from the world, and from himſelf. But when he did ſee and hear nearby that whereof the Lord had given him ſo much impreſſion
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34188:123"/>whilſt he was afarr of, then he felt quite an other thing in his ſoul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides although he did not live long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, yet the Lord even ſome time before his death gave witneſs that he was in a frame to be admitted into the number of members of his Church amongſt us; and we were juſt ready to acknowledge him for ſuch, when he was ſuddainly taken ſick, and ſhortly afterwards he died of that ſickneſs. But what could not then be done according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, and expreſly in the aſſembly of the Church, this was fully teſtified unto him in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In which God did perfect our comfort, and did very compleatly enlarge the work of his grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him. And becauſe before his ſickneſs divers things were to be done, he therefore did betake him ſelf to all whatſoever the Providence of God did lay before him, with ſuch a love and courage of mind, being ſupported by his zeal towards God, that we could not chooſe but be very much touched with it, and moved
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34188:124"/>to give thanks to God for that heart where with he inabled him to do all things, and for that holy forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of himſelf which did moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear in his whole converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When ſome times we ſhewed ſome admiration at his great readineſs to take upon him, and to do all whatſoever did occurr, he ſaid with a great deal of ſimplicity and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>I would willingly be as Samuell, &amp; be able to ſay with him in all things, ſpeak Lord for thy ſervant heareth.</hi> We going for Zonderen, he remained ſome while with certain others at Herfort, for ſomthing which he had yet to do there. And although this did not happen without ſome deniall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet however it was with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed embracing of the will of the Lord, which he followed in all things with great love. But when he came to us in the contrey, whereon the one ſide he found him ſelf diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the converſation with the people of this world, with whom he had to do in the city, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide where he could as it were
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34188:124"/>breathe in the pure and free air of the houſe of God, he ſaid with much fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>it is as if I was no more on earth.</hi> Neither was he there long, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently being taken ſick in a ſhort time he paſſed over to heaven. Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſelf ſometimes to the Lord Jeſus we heard him uttering theſe words, <hi>my Father, teach me thy wayes</hi> and finding himſelf at the point of going to him, he was then as wholly tranſported with that joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of glory, whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Peter ſpeaketh to the Faithfull.</p>
               <p>He had a great and truly Chriſtian love to the Children and ſervants of the Lord in common; but he ſhewed to have a very ſpeciall and tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for that great and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God Mr. de Labadie as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpeciall inſtrument, where by his ſpirit was pleaſed to do ſo much good both to him and us. We never heard him complain in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His heart was alwayes well at peace: it praiſed and bleſſed God without ceaſing. The holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy of his mind did appear in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34188:125"/>his face, and gave to him as it were a heavenly countenance, and it did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print ſomthing that was divine in all thoſe who ſaw him and ſpoke with him: ſeeing he had many viſits, not only becauſe he loved it much, but becauſe one could never go away from him but with comfort and joy for the grace which God did beſtow upon him. One bringing ſome thing to him for his refreſhment, he took it with acknowledgement and humility, ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull for they ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> Having need to be kopped, and he who kopped him, not being well experienced there in, he cauſed him much pain; but he ſuffered it with a laughing mouth and ſpeciall patience. And when he ſaw that the happy inſtant was even come, that he ſhould depart this world, and paſs over to God, he aſked if his brother in law was not yet come, and having underſtood that he was not come, he ſpoke with great aſſurance of faith, <hi>then I ſhall ſee him here after, for in my fathers houſe are many manſions.</hi> Being
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34188:125"/>full of the glory of Chriſt, he would ſome times cry out with love and gladneſs, <hi>Jeſus is King. He ſhall rule, and his Children ſhall ſee it and rule with him.</hi> Being aſked whether he was not contented with what God did, and would do to him, he anſwered <hi>

                     </gap>ea with all my heart.</hi> And ſeing he was juſt at his end, we preſented him again before the Lord in prayer, and ſaw him to join with a right godly zeal in what was ſpoken to God. He died in prayer, although at the beginning he himſelf uncovered his head with the others ſhewing his reverence for God. Thus this moſt bleſſed ſoul fell aſleep in his arms.</p>
               <p>The Lord having taken to him ſelf at Altena by Hamborrow Mr. de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badie, whom indeed he had given to us for a Father, in that comfortable manner as ſhall be ſeen elſewhere; our Siſter <hi>Elizabeth Sluiters</hi> was the fifth perſon amongſt us,<note place="margin">In the year <hi>1674</hi> in the month of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober.</note> whom God took up into his full reſt.

Coming there and finding that which her heart did ſeek, ſhe could not leave it, but went with us to Herfort: from whence ſhe went ſome time afterwards to Weſell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of joy becauſe of that great grace which God had beſtowed upon her in bringing her in the midſt of his Children. She quickly returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with full approbation of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to conſecrate her ſelf to God more then ever before, and to addict her ſelf to his ſervice. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34188:126"/>God came to her ſoul in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſpeciall manner and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him ſelf to her in love, ſo as that it continued with her for the moſt part till the time of her death. This made her commonly to be of ſuch a quiet heart, and ſo joyfull of ſpirit, ſo full of the praiſe of God, as that we could ſay that it was continually in her mouth, and laſtly very thankfull for thoſe great and good things which Chriſt Jeſus is come to obtain for his people. When we were come to Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ſhe advanced ſo much in light, in pureneſs of heart, in ſpirituall diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in forgetting and looſing of her ſelf, and in love of God and of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, that we ſaw her as wholly to flowe away in him and to burn with his divine flame. Before ſhe was taken ſick, ſhe was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to walk upon our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, there ſeeking and often times finding him whom her heart loved, &amp; lifting upher ſoul to him from that place, which ſhe conſidered as that which ſhould be the place in which her body was to be kept. God purely

                  <note place="margin">In the year <hi>1676.</hi> in the month of Maie.</note>Our Siſter <hi>Suſanna Spykershoff,</hi> the wife of our brother Dankers, did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her ſome time after. She came to us at Zunderen with her huſband, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Middleburgh the place of her birth &amp; habitation without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, &amp; all her acquaintance, ſhewing a great zeal to follow and ſeek God, to the place unto which ſhe felt him to draw their hearts. The trialls and dangers which they ſuffered were common to both of them; as alſo
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34188:133"/>the grace which God in his love had ſhewed to them both. Likewiſe were they at Altena both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for members of this body of Chriſt, and ſhe gave to us much comfort, both by her common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and by the purging out and renewing of her, which God from time to time wrought in her. She loved her husband very tenderly; but when God did call him to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place to the ſervice of his Work &amp; Children, ſhe embraced therein his will with much love: which in her was in a ſpeciall manner edifying, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that before when ſhe yet lived in the world, ſhe was wont to be much encumbred, when he was from home for to do their own affaires. God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving viſited her with great pains of the gravell &amp; ſtone, whether at Bremen, whilſt a part of our Aſſembly was there, or afterwards at Altena &amp; here in Frieſland, ſhe hath been a ſpeciall edification to his Houſe by her coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious mind and patience, which was animated with the love of Jeſus Chriſt. From whom ſhe drew vertue
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34188:133"/>and ſtrength to ſuffer to his glory and worthily of him. She paſſed over to the Lord ſome days after ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of her laſt Child. God being willing to try us by the danger where in we ſaw her when ſhe was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the little appearance there was that ſhe could be helped therein, yet however ſhe was not there at aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but contrarily ſhe herſelf did encourage that perſon who ſerved her, referring all things fully to the Lord, even as ſhe left and truſted herſelf to him. She ſaid, <hi>The Lord is with us, that is enough, all things go well.</hi> She looked upon death with great quietneſs, and teſtified, that ſhe never had found more reſt and contentment as then. And for as much as ſhe ſuffered great and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pains in her loins, which made her ſometimes to lament ſomething; ſhe could not forbear to ſay, that it was not for any thing but the body, but, ſhe ſaid, <hi>That God was very good to her ſoul.</hi> Sometimes ſhe ſaid, <hi>That ſhe was not able to expreſs the love which ſhe had for the Children of God:</hi> and yet
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34188:134"/>we ſaw that ſhe left them with joy, to go to their Father, who likewiſe was become hers in Chriſt. Being ſcars able to ſpeak any more, yet ſhe gave notice with what tenderneſs ſhe took part in the converſion of a ſoul whereof ſhe was told, in whom the grace of God had appeared in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner: and a little after ſhe yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up her ſpirit into the arms of the Lord, to reſt therein for ever. The years of her age were 33.</p>
               <p>After her followed our Siſter <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharin Rooland.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the year <hi>1678.</hi> in the month of Aprill.</note> She having lived a very bad life in the world, did part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Gods Providence, and partly by the motion of his Spirit come to us at Amſterdam; yet being very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Whilſt ſhe was there, God touched her heart, inlightened and humbled her, and laid in her ſome ſeeds of his grace which from time to time did lively ſhew themſelves, but alſo oftentimes were ſuppreſſed, darkned and aſſaulted by her corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by a certain irregularity which was proper to her nature, and to which ſhe had formerly given full
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34188:134"/>liberty. The Lord at Herfort ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhewed ſomething in her which was very pure and eſſentiall, ſhe was there received for a member, after which returning again to her ſelf, ſhe was to us much ſorrow, and did a long time exerciſe the long-ſuffering of the Lord; but at the laſt God was pleaſed to give us much comfort of her before he took her away. When he viſited her with ſickneſs, ſhe told us, <hi>That ſhe did believe that ſhe ſhould ſoon die, and that for ſome time ſhe had a great impreſſion in her heart that ſhe ſhould not live long any more, wiſhing herſelf,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that ſhe might die, in hopes that God would then come more to her, and cauſe her more to feel his grace and mercy.</hi> She was very full of this mind, and of this hope, when God came to her to do in her as it was a miracle of his grace &amp; power. It was after that ſhe had been ſick for ſome weeks, that the Lord did work very lively in her, and made her from time to time to utter divers words which did lively ſhew what he did in her heart. The evening before ſhe died, whilſt we were at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34188:135"/>ſhe prayed though being withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; dry, ſaying: <hi>My God leave me not I pray thee. Do not ſurpriſe me in my own ſpirit, nor in my ſins. If thou ſhouldeſt forſake me ſatan ſhould prevail over me, that enemy of my ſoul, who hath laid ſo many ſnares for me, and hath ſo much ſought to bring me to ruin. He is an inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably greedy one. He can not endure that one only ſoul ſhall ſerve God her Creatour, though there are ſo many that ſerve him. Indeed,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I am a miſerable one in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects? and yet what violence hath he not uſed to have me? I have horribly ſuffered of him; but indeed it hath been by my own corruption.</hi> She cryedout, <hi>Lord, I have ſuch a hard heart, I can not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf, I can not alter my ſelf. If thou ſhouldeſt leave me I ſhould grow impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and froward.</hi> And a little after ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am not worthy to lay here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bed, I would fain lay upon the earth and die there. O how am I aſhamed to ſee my ſelf laying upon a bed, whereas the Lord Jeſus, the Son of David and the Son of God, did die upon a croſs. My God, give me a little of thy Sprit, in theſe my laſt hours: in theſe laſt hours,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34188:135"/>my God, be thou pleaſed to be gracious and mercifull unto me.</hi> Having with much humility entreated, that we ſhould pray for her, and the Lord after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being much drawn near to her ſoul, ſhe ſaid with much affection of her heart at night between two and three the clock, <hi>that her ſoul was is wholly illuminated, that the Lord was come to her, that he had opened her heart, that he had taken away the fear of death from her,</hi> which ſhe two days before the laſt coming of the Lord to her, had felt. To which ſhe added, <q>The Lord hath heard the prayers of his Children for me. what a great mercy, what an unconceivable goodneſs, O my Gouvernour! O how well hath God done all things! I have ſinned, I have ſinned: forgive, forgive, O my God, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, with Manaſſe.</q> At an other time ſhe ſaid, <q>I feel that ſelf love would willingly be in heaven, but it will never be able to come into it; nothing can come into it but by the pure love and the only infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy of God, revealed unto
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34188:136"/>us in Chriſt Jeſus. I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid ſhe, fallen into the water: God might have ſuffered me to be drowned therein; but he was not willing to ſurpriſe me in my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp; in my ſins. He hath kept me alife till this time. O how good is God, that he doth not cloſe my mouth, but yet ſuffereth me that I may move my tongue to praiſe his mercy. The Lord hath kept me by him and his Work as with force, by the power of his truth, and help of his faithfull Servants. If I was now in the world, deprived of thoſe means which the Lord giveth me here, how miſerable indeed would be my ſtate! It is by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy that God hath kept me at his Work. What ſhould not I have been if I had been left to my ſelf!</q> Being ſenſible that ſhe had oftentimes greeved the pure Spirit of God in his Children, ſhe ſaid, <q>I am unworthy to ſpeak any more to any one: I have deſerved that I ſhould be left to lay as a beaſt. I have been a prater in the Houſe of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34188:136"/>the Lord. If God ſhould reſtore me again to health, I ought to be the firſt that ſhould keep ſilence, and the laſt to ſpeak, and my voice ought not to be heard in his Houſe. I muſt not ſpeak but to aſhame and condemn my ſelf. Thoſe whom God hath well purged, it fits them to ſpeak: and not ſuch a ſinner as I am.</q> My Brother Dulignon coming to her in the morning, ſhe ſaid preſently that ſhe was unworthy to ſee him, &amp; aſhamed that he came to her. She ſaid, <q>I am unworthy that a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoul, a ſoul that liveth to God and ſerveth him, ſhould ſpeak with me, or that I ſhould have the happineſs to ſpeak with it. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to die, without having any to ſpeak with me. I have given ſo much trouble, let none take any more for me. If God ſuffereth yet one word more to be ſpoken to me, that is nothing but meer mercy.</q> We calling her with the name of ſiſter, ſhe anſwered me: <hi>I am unworthy to be ſo called, I dare not call you brother.</hi> She declared that ſhe had great greef, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34188:137"/>in her ſickneſs ſhe had not given more edification, and ſhewed that ſhe had taken to much care about her body, She ſaid, <q>that her ſtate was to her as a myſtery: that ſhe knew not what to ſay of it, feeling both ſin and mercy. Gods mercy is infinite, it is infinite, cryed ſhe; my ſins alſo are as infinitely great, which ſhe repeated more then once.</q> And afterwards ſhe ſaid, <q>I am a creature an evill doer, and God is that Creatour that doeth good. O what great a grace is the grace of repentance! O if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to give me yet ſome time, that I might humble my ſelf before his Children, and juſtifie him!</q> When they would give her a little wine, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I deſerve to be drenched with my corruption, and am not worthy to enjoy a drop of water.</hi> when I ſpoke to her of praying to God that it might pleaſe him to receive her into his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hands: ſhe anſwered, <q>At his feet, for it is yet to great a grace that God endureth me at his feet, and ſayeth not to me, depart
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34188:137"/>hence. She ſaid, I would willingly kreep into the duſt at the feet of the creatures, to ſhew how much I wiſh to caſt myſelf down at the feet of the Creatour. Men call themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Chriſtians, but what great a matter is that indeed!</q> My Brother Dulignon a little while after coming to her again, ſhe ſaid <q>You come yet again to me, I am unworthy of it? but I love it much, feeling the good which it doth to my ſoul. I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you both much trouble, but God will be your eternall reward. You have told me the truth in all things. The Lord hath now put me in a ſtate to be as a bowle, which he rowleth where he will. I know now what that word meaneth which I have heard ſometimes. She had ſaid before That which the Lord doth in me, is that he enableth me to go to him, to give my ſelf over to his freedom, &amp; to throw my ſelf down at his feet, untill he himſelf ſhall thruſt me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if he in his adorable juſtice ſhall think it fit, as a thing that is not worthy to be touched with his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34188:138"/>hands. God will always be found juſt in his doing.</q> One might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the anointing of the Spirit even ſo farr as in her very words. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated every one to pardon her all wherein ſhe had done amiſs to them. She ſaid, <hi>God cometh to purge his Houſe and to cleanſe it of ſuch an unfaithfull one as I be. My body being weak, I can not ſpeak much to you.</hi> To which ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to one whom ſhe exhorted to purge herſelf throughly and to be faithfull to the Lord; <hi>But I ſpeak to you as being before God, and going to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him. The Lord hath received me for a member of his Church, but I have not anſwered this grace.</hi> Likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an other occaſion ſhe ſaid, <hi>O how great a good is it to be able to do ſomething in the Houſe of the Lord, although it were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gather ſome wood!</hi> She was flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and brokenhearted, making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in nothing, and as a Child in all things what was told her, or deſired of her. At the laſt ſhe fell a ſleep (being about 43 years old) ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with great humility in God, as a guilty ſoul, which caſteth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34188:138"/>down at the feet of her judge, to hear her ſentence to be given, feeling herſelf worthy of his judgement, &amp; yet taking great refuge to his mercy, and the blood of Chriſt Jeſus her great Redeemer. She ſaid, <hi>Two ſorts of ſouls go to God: penitent; and thoſe that love: but I will be one of the firſt.</hi> Her countenance had ſomething ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall after her death, &amp; her ſoul went out ſo peaceably and quietly with the laſt words of the prayer, wherewith we preſented her before God, that it was hardly perceived.</p>
               <p>Our worthy &amp; bleſſed Siſter Mrs. Schurman being paſſed over into Gods boſom, as will be ſeen in her life; thereupon our very worthy Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mrs. <hi>van der Haer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the year <hi>1678.</hi> in the month of July.</note> whoſe three daughters with her were members of this body of Chriſt, and whom we looked upon as a Mother, was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily delivered by death from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of weakneſs. In the life of Mr. van der Haer her husband, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then ſhe had but little inclination to the common cours of the world, which was oftentimes burdenſom to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:34188:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>her. After his deceaſe ſhe gave her Children liberty to do according to their heart in what concerned the worſhip of God. She received us in her houſe at the Hague with much love and civility, though then as yet ſhe had but little lively feeling &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that which God worketh in thoſe that are his. She came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit us at Amſterdam; at ſuch a time when it pleaſed God to bring us into many trials. And yet then it was that the Lord began to give her a taſte of his Spirit, giving her ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his pure truth, that ſhe was not ſufficiently able to expreſs it, and whereof the remainders a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after were again powerfully ſtirred up and made lively. Two of her daughters with her approbation being come to us at Herfort, ſhe came with the third, thinking after ſome time to return with them together; but ſhe was ſo happy that God himſelf kept her there, and revealed himſelf in his grace and love to her heart. The Lord Jeſus wrought ſo lively in her, that we ſaw in truth a ſoul as
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34188:139"/>was that of Nicodemus to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and born again, which ſhe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wanted much. She found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf then to be ſo inwardly and from the bottom of her heart united with this Church of Jeſus Chriſt, whereof God made her a member, that ſhe could not leave the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and the ſenſe of thankfulneſs for the grace which God beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her in her laſt days, was ſo lively and tender in her, that we took of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times pleaſure to hear with what taſt and fulneſs of heart ſhe ſpoke thereof. She ſaid, <hi>what a goodneſs is it that God hath ſo received me when I ſought him not but lived wholly to my ſelf!</hi> Some times ſhe ſaid, <hi>What a grace is it that God hath not caſt of my weak and maimed members, but will yet uſe them for his ſervice.</hi> Likewiſe ſhe did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them to all whereunto ſhe was fit, with ſuch a zeal and love for God and his Children, that many times it hath very lively touched our hearts. She never refuſed any thing that was brought to her to do, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one brought it willingly to her,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34188:140"/>becauſe her great inclination to keep herſelf employed for the Lord and his Children was known. She was very tenderly ſenſible of that good which ſhe did dayly receive from the Lord, and ſhe had ſuch a love for the Lord Jeſus his Kingdom and his glory, that one might ſee as it was a new life come into her, when ſhe did but ſpeak of it. Although ſhe was of a very great age, yet ſhe followed the Lord in his Work untill the end with an admirable courage of mind. She came with us from Altena into Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, having otherwiſe never paſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſea. And from hence ſhe went for Holland, not withſtanding her weakneſs, to take order about her buſineſs, and likewiſe being very willing to bear witneſs of that which God had done in her and cauſed her to find among his Children. After that ſhe had taken order about all things according to the will of God ſhe returned again, although they were willing to keep her at the Hague. After that ſhe did wholly fix and center herſelf upon God, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34188:140"/>a very Chriſtian ſimple and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life before his Face. I have many times been much comforted, ſeeing the light which was powred forth in her ſoul, and the faithfulneſs in which ſhe walked through the Spirit before God and the face of Jeſus Chriſt. Her peace and the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her heart did agree with the goodneſs of God towards her. She ſaid, <q>God hath called me at the laſt hour, and is it not a great goodneſs that it pleaſeth him to give me the ſame reward, which thoſe ſhall receive that have laboured the whole day. O ſaid ſhe, what cauſe have I to thank Tetje (ſo ſhe called her eldeſt daughter) that ſhe hath ſo faithfully helped me to come out of the world! Could I ever think that God had laid up ſuch a great good for me, who have ſpent my ſelf in the cours of the world? O (ſaid ſhe ſpeaking to her daughters) how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are you that you are called even in your youth, by the Lord to his ſervice.</q> Seeing the love of the Children of God, who did behave themſelves
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34188:141"/>towards her as to their mother, ſhe ſaid with affection of heart, <q>O how doth not God give a hundred fold, even in this life, when one hath loſt all in his hands!

He cauſeth my ſins to paſs by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, as if I were to ſee all in haſt, for my time is ſhort.</q> She having found ſome adherence to a child of her daughter, ſhe was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wary that ſhe might not ſuffer her heart to be taken up with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after that God had taken the firſt out of the world. She was very looſe of her goods, and her neglect &amp; forgetfulneſs of all what ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were unuſuall. When God laid any diſeaſes and pains upon her ſhe bare them with a ſpeciall ſtrength yea and with ſuch a ſilence, that we were afterwards aſtoniſhed to ſee
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34188:141"/>what ſhe had ſuffered, without making any mention of it. God having gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a little while before her happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, that we did vew the ſtate of our ſouls (as we do the ſame from time to time, whether it be to praiſe him for his grace, or to ſtirr our ſelves up to greater faithfulneſs,) &amp; divers admonitions in the aſſembly having been given to her, ſhe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with ſo much humility, love and earneſtneſs, that we were in a ſpeciall manner comforted and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her inward attention before God, and with the renewing of his grace, which wrought the ſame in her. Likewiſe after that ſhe ſaid, <hi>that now ſhe had no more to do, and was ready to depart from hence, if God ſhould call her.</hi> When God came to take to himſelf our worthy Siſter Schur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe ſaid unto her with joy, <hi>I will ſoon follow you, worthy ſiſter.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as likewiſe happened, for the Lord did not ſtay long to call her to him ſelf. She ſhewed in her ſickneſs, which took her away in few days, that ſhe had a great feeling of her ſins,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34188:142"/>which did humble her before God &amp; his Children. She likewiſe ſhewed a great confidence on Chriſt her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and a great love to go and behold his Face; and ſhe was as much aſſured that he ſhould here on earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh all things as if ſhe ſaw it with her eyes. Some times ſhe ſaid, <hi>Children, I love you all very much, but when the Lord Jeſus ſhall call me, O how glad ſhall I be to leave you!</hi> She prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſelf to ſuffer more; but God came to end her torments ſpeedily, taking her to himſelf in a very eaſy manner, and to the great comfort of his Children. She ſaid two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her death, <hi>that ſhe did conſider her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the ſacrifice upon the altar, which expected the fire from heaven to conſume it.</hi> And the morning before ſhe went to God one of her daughters being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give her ſomething for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, ſhe ſaid <hi>Give me no more, for it is fit that I ſhould ſuffer ſome thing before I come to my end.</hi> Some one telling her there upon, your ſuffering will not continue long, for I hope that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night doth come, you will be in

And ſo ſhe came and continued with us untill God in his love hath taken her away from us. A little while after ſhe came to us, her heart was ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched with thoſe truths which ſhe heard, and got ſuch light about her ſtate, that ſhe never afterwards loſt the impreſſion thereof.

Her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions were ſtrong and deeply roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the hand of God was yet ſtronger to root them out. His truth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34188:143"/>was as a hammer, which did beat to peeces her hard heart, his grace did mollify it, and his love did finally conquer it, and formed it into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart. God made her looſe of fleſh and blood, of the world, and of the earth, of her ſelf and of her moſt inward corruptions. He gave her a hatred againſt her ſelf, and ſuch a love for his truth and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who made the ſame known to her, and whom ſhe ſaw to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, that ſhe could not reſiſt the ſame. She was ſo much aſhamed becauſe of the goodneſs of God, who had brought her into his houſe, not withſtanding her having been ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly earthly minded, and ſhe was ſo taken up with the long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Spirit, who had ſo long endured her there, that ſhe could not ſufficiently expreſs it. Likewiſe when ſhe went amongſt perſons of the world, and ſhe was told that we did not bear with ſouls, but were to ſevere, ſhe did always propound herſelf for an example, to ſhew the great forbearance which God in this
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34188:144"/>his Houſe did cauſe to be exerciſed, towards thoſe who in ſome upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will die to themſelves and the world. She did love to be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to herſelf, and did shew a great acknowledgement thereof when in faithfulneſs we did help her therein. God from time to time gave her very purelight. She found herſelf to be ſometimes much affected with his Divine preſence, and to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by delivered from her temptations, or her own humane thoughts. She did as it were drink in the truth and the good word of God, when ſhe heard it in the aſſemblys. <hi>Her heart,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>did continually ſay Amen to all what ſhe heard.</hi> The Lord tried her ſoul ſometime before ſhe died, in a ſpeciall manner humbling her before his preſence, and cauſing her inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feel a bitter ſmart for her ſins which ſhe had committed againſt him. She was eſpecially ſorry aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and greeved for thoſe ſins where by ſhe had made herſelf guilty about the Work of the Lord by her own judgement, and was more ſenſible
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34188:144"/>of this then ſhe could tell. In her laſt ſickneſs which ſhe got after that ſhe had helped our ſiſter V. with much love, ſhe ſaid with acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God hath taken away all my care, which kept her in great reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, who keeping her buſy with his Goodneſs, made her to looſe the thoughts and even the ſenſe of her ſuffering. She took it in love, and in the ſpirit of true repentance, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that repentance was not ſo ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that ſhe had great need to continue there in to the end. I feel,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>within ſuch a reſt and peace that I can not expreſs it.</hi> She cryed out, <hi>what good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what power, that God hath made ſuch a rebellious creature obedient unto him!</hi> She received with much humility the ſervice which was done to her: and thanked the Lord Jeſus for that he had brought her to this his Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and that likewiſe he took her to himſelf from the midſt of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And ſo ſhe fell aſleep, even as we have all cauſe to beleeve, in his arms and boſom.</p>
